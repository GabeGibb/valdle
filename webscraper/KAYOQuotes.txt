"Throwing charge."
"Throwing charge."
"Grenade!"
"Grenade!"
"Grenade out."
"Grenade out."
"They're in pieces."
"No chance."
"That was brutal."
"Flashbang."

"Knife deployed!"
"Knife deployed!"
"One suppressed!"

"No one walks away!"
"You are powerless!"
"I need a reset."
"Emergency reset required."
"Requesting manual reset."
"System failure."
"Critical damage."
"Shutting down."
"Back online!"
"Core systems restored."
"Thank you."
"Now, where was I?"
"Resuming your termination."
"Thanks for the reboot."
"What's the plan, send the robot in first? Smart choice."
"I'm about to go full killer robot. You've been warned."
"Fight well. This world depends on it."
"I'll take the lead. It cost enough to build me. Get your money's worth."
"If no one objects, I'll go nix these targets. Company's welcome."
"More hostiles trying to kill us, what's new?"
"We have one job; save this Earth. No excuses."
"Deploy the killer robot to an urban population center. Great idea."
"Everyone's motor functions okay? I know humans get tired."
"Let's make a plan, then execute."
"Catch a breath. Not that I need to of course."
"Attack when they're suppressed. I cut their options, they make mistakes."
"Activating kill mode. That's a joke. Kill mode is default."
"I will fulfill my purpose."
"If I'm powered down, restart me. You leave me for scrap, I'll kill you."
"I'll shut them down. Until then, survive."
"I'll survive a dent or two, can't say the same for you fragile humans."
"Bragging rights if you get first pick."
"Don't get shot. Human brains are hard to replace."
"Let's go kill them all again."
"Keep the momentum."
"Just like last time. Search, destroy, repeat."
"I could activate training mode if that's more their skill level."
"We're not done yet, but soon at this rate."
"I don't blame them for fighting, but it won't help."
"I'm enjoying this."
"Never back down."
"Here we go. Rally up!"
"Break down, rebuild, back in it!"
"We're moving out, pack heavy."
"Load up, we're not coming back."
"They're fighting to the end. Typical, and pointless."
"I could fight forever, but we should wrap this up."
"Maybe we get the spike. Just a thought."
"We forgot the spike. Good start."
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm saving."
"I'm saving."
"I can buy for you."
"I can buy for you."
"Need a drop."
"Need a drop."
"Bring it."
"I won't lose you all again."
"Hold the line."
"Advance."
"Press forward."
"Brace for impact."
"Tangos incoming, light them up."
"Destroy them again."
"Over the top, let's go!"
"Stand by to get some."
"Whatever it takes."
"Dig deep."
"We need an edge, leave it to me."
"Charlie Mike, let's move."
"Don't worry, I'll keep them quiet."
"Heads down, guns up, get deadly."
"Kill all your opponents."
"Let's get this done."
"Clear to engage, weapons hot."

"You want a piece of this?!"
"Come get it!"
"KO!"
"Do not resist."
"I can do this all day."
"Executed!"
"Get out!"
"Three kills!"
"Three kills!"
"Four kills!"
"Four kills!"
"Next time, mind the heavy machinery."
"Time to die, don't make a fuss."
"I would let you live, but that does not compute."
"Survivors rest, I'll clean up."
"And we're clear."
"That was cold, even for me."
"Is that the best you've got?"
"Final target."
"Final target."
"I'm busy."
"Forget it."
"Taking one for the team."
"Nice knowing you."
"Try again."
"I detonate. You don't."
"Get out of my kill zone!"
"I know what they're thinking, "aimbot"."
"I was built for this!"
"Go back to fighting bots."
"I bet you've never seen a can opener do that."
"I'm built different."
"No one kills my crew."
"That lot was trash."
"That was badass."
"A quick reboot, I'll be fine."
"Is Killjoy here? I could use some repairs."
"Better weapons? Big deal."
"No rest required. Ready for redeployment."
"Game over!"
"Good fight. Where to next?"
"Okay humans, now you can swim."
"Almost had it."
"They were in my sights."
"Rematch, let's go!"
"Humans allied with Radiants. What a strange world."
"I told you Radiants are dangerous."
"Time to kill some Radiants."
"Radiant killed."
"An enemy Astra. Powerful, but killable."
"Their Astra doesn't protect reality, she destroys worlds. I would know."
"Astra's dead."
"Breach, after this, billiards. I like taking your money."
"Steamroll them, Breach."
"Brimstone, I'd hug you but it would kill you. I'm serious, no hugs."
"Your second chance, Brimstone. I won't fail you again."
"Brimstone, game plan! Let's do what we did at the Battle of Hell's Bridge.""KAY/O, I have no idea what you're talking about."
 "KAY/O, I have no idea what you're talking about."
"You are a boss, Brimstone!"
"I got your back, Brim."
"Cypher, you keep eyeing my hardware. Don't."
"I'll crash their Cypher's network."
"Let's see their Jett fight without wind."
"Toaster!"
"Break him down, I need the spare parts."
"Someone missed a software update."
"Killjoy calls her tech "killer robots". Good joke. Funny."
"I'll shut down Killjoy's tech."
"Too advanced, even for you."
"Omen, you are a capable fighter. Okay, that is all."
"Radiant target acquired. Uh, hang on, it's Phoenix. Sorry, friend."
"No fire, no Phoenix."
 "KAY/O, level with me. Is there anything you can't do out here?"
"Uh, sneak past a metal detector. First thing that comes to mind."
"Okay, Raze. Your paint shells, my fragments, maximum damage."
"Raze, you are incredible. Well done, friend."
"Explosives ready, Raze!"
"Reyna, I'm programmed to kill you. Don't give me a reason."
"Reyna, I acknowledge your performance. Brimstone ordered me to."
"I'll destroy every Reyna for what she did to you- correction, them."
"Another Reyna. I killed her in the war, I'll kill her again."
"That Reyna won't touch a soul! I'll make sure of it."
"Killed the queen!"
"Your reign is over."
"It is strange, Sage. Where I'm from, you're no medic, only a weapon."
"Sage, "healer", what an understatement."
"I've seen what the enemy Skye becomes. Deal with her now. Trust me."
"Their Skye is weak without her beasts. I'm on it."
"Skye destroyed."
"Side by side again, Sova. Let's get lethal."
"You are a machine, Sova. Well, part machine."
"I'm with you to the end, Sova."
"Yoru, I must now classify you as a major threat. You understand."
"Keep that Yoru contained."
"Yoru is dead."
