"There they are."
"There they are."
"Found them."
"Found them."
"I, am the hunter!"
"Nowhere to run!"
"They should've dug a deeper grave."
"Thank you."
"This bow has taken man and beast alike. I have found there is little difference."
"There is no retreat. Not when annihilation is at stake. This is our day."
"Don't be afraid. I've gone through rifts before."
"I believe in all of you, like I believe in myself."
"I was told you are all the best. That is why I'm here."
"You'll have your intel. I promise."
"You have me. That is good for you."
"Another day, another battle. So be it. I do not fear blood on my hands."
"Remember, the enemy defends this world. It is their home, and that makes them dangerous."
"We will not withdraw until their radianite is ours."
"Anyone that lays a hand on our radianite may find a bullet in their jaw."
"As long as there is breath in your lungs, you have the strength to fight. Hold them back!"
"The cold air feels wonderful!"
"Watch them run when lit by my sonar. That's when we strike."
"Level heads until we're home, yes? Good."
"If you're not a good shot today, don't worry. There are other ways to be useful."
"My quiver is never full."
"What do you say, drone. Ready to stretch your wings?"
"Stay taut as a bowstring. The fight demands it."
"We are strong because we are together. Don't forget that."
"They demand a fight. Who are we to disobey?"
"Enemies close. Eyes up."
"Act on my intel. Don't give them time to reposition."
"A bow and arrow is old fashioned. But sometimes old ways are best."
"Keep them in our sights."
"I have survived more than they have ever seen."
"Stay on their trail."
"One step closer."
"If we go easy on them, they will never learn."
"Why are they so determined to die?"
"I expected better of them."
"A second wind. Let your senses come alive!"
"The winds shift in our favor."
"They aren't impervious. We can do this!"
"Buy all you need."
"Save nothing."
"We can end it now. Once more!"
"Their winter has come. Bury them!"
"The best of the best and we still forget the spike."
"At some point we'll have to get the spike."
"I'm gearing up."

"I have money."
"I have money."
"Need a drop."

"Protect our homeland."
"Keep them cornered."
"Keep them cornered."
"Overtake them."
"Beat them back."

"Protect our motherland!"
"Leave them no escape!"
"Break away."
"Never lose sight."
"They tire. We don't."
"Eyes on target."
"Repel them."
"Pick them off."
"Let us hunt."
"Deep breath."
"Hunt them down."
"Ready."
"Come, into the unknown!"
"Eyes up."
"I'll find them."

"Be still."
"Death is cold, friend."
"It is done."
"No more to oppose us."
"Be at rest."
"You should pay more attention."
"I'm not just an archer, you know."
"I've survived much worse than you."
"No one escapes my sight. No one."
"One target left."
"One target left."
"Back to work."
"Back to work."
"Concentrate, Sova."
"Concentrate, Sova."
"You failed. Now flee."
"It is over."
"Is there no one left?"
"You cannot escape!"
"None escape me."
"Is that it?!"
"Never come back!"
"I'll tear through you all!"
"Who else do you have?!"
"A little recognition is nice, now and then. Thank you."
"Do not hunt the hunter."
"I love you all."
"You all are wonderful!"
"Now this is worth celebrating!"
"We all did our part!"
"The pack survives!"
"Close one."
"Nice shot."
"They sacrifice for nothing."
"Today is not our day to die."
"I'm not tired. Are you?"
"Okay, that is done."
"Tracked and hunted."
"The snow should hide our tracks. We were never here."
"A little recognition is nice, now and then. Thank you."
"My babushka told me not to brag. But for this I make an exception!"
"You were nothing compared to the alpha!"
"Good thing I was with you, yes?"
"Good. Next time, better."
"This will do."
"I am pleased."
"Sleep, brother."
"Breach, we can only follow up if you wait for us. Nothing comes from rushing."
"Their Breach has no patience at all. He attacks fast, be ready to move."
"Stop their Breach at all costs."
"Thug."
"Brimstone, after we win, I'll buy you a drink if you share a memory with us."
"Lead us to victory, Brimstone."
"Brimstone! You are a true leader!"
"At your command, Brimstone."
"Captain killed."
"Be at peace, my friend."
"Chamber, you are a good shot. But when you can bounce your bullets off the wall, then I'll be impressed."
"You've buried your secrets well, Cypher. But I am a hunter, and I will find them."
"Sova, I accessed your background file, a good story! But that's not really how you lost your eye."
"And your file is missing, Amir. Explain that."
"Okay Cypher, I admit. That was good."
"Take out Cypher's cameras. He's weak when he's blind."
"I'm done with Cypher's secrets."
"No more secrets."
"Goodbye, Cypher. You will not be missed."
"Fade, with you and I on the field, the enemy's plans will crumble."
"Fade, well fought! There is no other hunter quite like you."
"Swiftly and silent, Fade."
"The enemy Fade will use our fear against us. So it is better to be fearless I think."
"The monsters that Fade commands are imitations at best. She does not frighten me."
"Now, swallow your fear!"
"The hunt does not always go as planned, does it?"
"May the wind guide your blades, Jett, and my arrows."
"Jett! You were amazing!"
"Jett, fly safe."
"Their Jett is fast! So are rabbits and squirrels. I hunt both."
"Listen for the wind. It will tell you where their Jett is."
"Killjoy is no threat without her toys. Break them and remove her."
"Neon, perhaps I will nock an arrow in advance. There is very little time to react once you start the fight."
"Omen, we will find your answer. You will not be this way forever. I promise."
"Don't forget who you are, Omen. A man, not a monster."
"Thank you, Omen. Startled prey is easier to hunt."
"Be strong, Omen."
"It is difficult tracking their Omen, but not impossible. I can do it."
 "Hey Sova! We're gonna hit the chessboard after this yeah?"
"You lack the patience, friend. Learn that first, then we'll approach strategy."
"In the wild, fire means life. You be our fire, Phoenix."
"Вот это да. No one can beat our Phoenix!"
"Raze, you always work to lift our spirits. Thank you."
"Quiet now."
"Their Reyna prepares on the other side. Kill her before she becomes monstrous."
"I did not expect a healer to fight so well. You are incredible."
"Sage, protect the others."
"Take out their healer."
"Sova, I spared you when we first met. I can't let you go again."
"I must kill my reflection. It's the only way forward."
"Беги, Sova."
"A fine death."
"It was you, or me."
"Your justice frightens me, Viper. Is there no other way to find peace?"
"Viper. For a scientist, you are very violent."
"I will put their Viper down. It is mercy."
"Be quiet!"
