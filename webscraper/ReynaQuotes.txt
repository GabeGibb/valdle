"They will cower!"
"The hunt begins!"
"All mine!"
"All mine!"
"Oh, the rush."
"Oh, the rush."
"More, more!"
"More, more!"
"Ah, back where I belong."
"It doesn't matter what this place used to be. Now it's just another graveyard."
"Ah, what hope do these criaturas have? I almost pity them."
"Are those our enemies? Huh. This won't take long."
"I've stood over so many corpses. A few more, does not matter."
"This enemy's nothing special. Still human, still mortal."
"I will drain the life from our prey. That's all they're good for."
"I have lied, beaten, killed to survive. I will kill again and again if it means one more day."
"As many souls as it takes Lucia. Te lu juro."
*sighs* "Today the meal came to me. Óptimo."
*sighs* "This poor place. It clings to life. A city after my own heart"
"As much as this world hurt me, it's mine, and I will kill to defend it."
"The enemy only looks composed. Their hearts tell a different story."
"I'm the last thing they'll see before they die. Lucky them."
"They're just batteries, and I need a recharge."
"Their lives are so meaningless. Might as well give them to me."
"Look your enemy in the eye. It helps with accuracy."
"Stay alive! I want their life, not yours."
"They don't have a single life worth saving."
"Deep breaths everyone. Your hearts are pounding."
"My city needs me. I can't be away for long. Let's end this quickly."
"Ah, the symphony of death. Don't worry, you get used to it."
"We showed them their place. Now keep them there."
"You see? They're flawed. Ordinary."
"That should humble them."
"Feels good, doesn't it? Now do it again!"
"If you've never seen a massacre, this is what it looks like."
"They're losing heart. I can feel it."
"They're starting to panic. I can feel their pulse quickening from here."
"Ah, those fools just wasted their advantage."
"They couldn't kill us. Now, they're dead."
"Time for them to kneel."
"Don't be cheap. Spend it all before it's gone."
"Don't be cheap. Spend it all before it's gone."
"Their head is in the guillotina, now pull!"
"Stamp out their last breath."
"How did we forget the spike?"
"How did we forget the spike?"
"Buying."
"Buying."
"Saving."
"Saving."
"What do you need?"
"What do you need?"
"Need a drop."
"Need a drop."
"Break them."
"They forget their place."
"At least they kept it interesting."
"They want to die? Let them."
"I get what I want."
"Take everything."
"Take control."
"Let's remind them who we are."
"We are ready for them."
"I will rip their hearts out."
"Bleed them dry."
"For you, hermanita."
"Embarrass them."
"No prisoners."
"Cower, run!"
"We win, we survive."
"Let's watch 'em struggle."
"Hush!"
"Pathetic!"
"Pathetic!"
"Finished."
"Finished!"
"Insecto."
"Insecto."
"You're done."
"Poor wretch."
"Enough."
"Die!"
"Adiós."
"Dead."
"Don't resist."
"You're nothing!"
"You're nothing!"
"No need to suffer."
"You disappoint me."
"You disappoint me."
"Shoo!"
"Embarrassing."
"Out of my way!"
"Butchered!"
"Three souls."
"Three souls."
"Four dead."
"Four dead."
"You were barely worth the effort."
"Don't worry, your life won't go to waste."
"All dead, *scoffs*, and I'm still hungry."
"Be grateful I killed you quickly."
"You were pitiful."
"Hello darling."
"You are so disappointing."
"How sad. You're just like everyone else."
"It's playtime."
"It's playtime."
"Don't insult me."
"Don't insult me."
*sighs* "Don't rush me"
*sighs* "Don't rush me"
"Did you really expect that to work?"
"Bow before me!"
"Thank you. I was starving!"
"Die meaningless."
"What can I say. When I want something, I take it."
"If I act superior, it's because I am."
"My heart's racing!"
"You should stop trying."
"They're nothing to me!"
"Such trash!"
"Ha! Let them rot!"
"Poor, miserable criaturas."
"Ugh, I don't die so easily!"
"That cost them everything, and me? Well, nothing."
"Keep your weapons. This heart is all I need."
"They stopped breathing? Excellent. Then we're done."
"Somehow the hunger always lingers."
"I'd thought they'd have more to offer. How foolish of me."
"Someone else will clean up. I don't take out the trash."
"I was not meant for this climate, let's go!"
"If I act superior, it's because I am."
"What can I say. When I want something, I take it."
"That was a snack. I want a meal."
"Next time I'll be on top."
"Not first? Disappointing."
"Today is a gift to Radiants. We're finally free to use our power!"
"Oh, do your little machines need help? Take your time. We Radiantes will start without you."
"You could never hope to match a Radiante!"
"Enough of your technology! The future is Radiant!"
"I like the way you work, Breach. Violento. Me gusta."
"Breach killed."
"Brimstone, if you must lead, then lead well. Where do we go?"
"If that Brimstone is like ours, he's not going to quit. Let's make him retire, shall we?"
"Ugh, I can't deal with the morality of yet another Brimstone! The hipocresía! I'll silence him."
"I'll show that Brimstone true power!"
"I don't like your toys, Cypher. Don't spy on me."
"Cypher buried."
"Their Fade will need to be creative, I already live my nightmare."
"Reyna, you keep like glancing at me. Why you smiling?"
"Sorry cariño, you remind me of someone."
"Escúchame Gekko, I am with you. No tienes que hacer todo solo."
"Gekko, fuerte y feroz. They will not hesitate, you must not either."
"Bien hecho Gekko, *chuckles* ustedes también chiquititos."
"Con cuidado, Gekko."
"Jett, you're very talented. Aim for the neck. Easy kill."
"Okay, Jett. Time to fly."
"Oi Jett, I remember being so young. It's good that you'll die before feeling old like me."
"Their Jett is playing hard to get. Alright, I'll play."
"KAY/O, you are the solution to a problem that does not exist. Déjame en paz."
"Focus your hate at the enemy, KAY/O, it is wasted on me."
"Their KAY/O can believe what he pleases, I do only what is necessary."
"KAY/O, la máquina de muerte muere hoy."
"KAY/O will not silence us."
"Terminado."
"I remember the machines Killjoy made. What they did to- never mind, it does not matter!"
"Enough with the robots, I want their maker."
"Killjoy is an offense to my Radiance. I'll break her apart!"
"I don't care how bright you are! You'll never be a Radiant!"
"Remember Neon, you are so much more than your powers. Show them."
"Harness your emotions, Neon. Just as we trained."
"Go Neon, defy your limits!"
"Omen, shall we see who cuts quicker? No harm in a little competition."
"Okay Omen, you won that round."
"Happy hunting, Omen."
"See you on the front lines, Phoenix. Save some enemies for me."
"Light the way, Phoenix."
"The sun is so bright. Don't worry. I'll kill him."
"Phoenix killed."
"Raze? Good. Never lose your voice."
"Raze dead."
"My reflection is here. Do me a favour, cariño. Kill her."
"You're mine, Reyna."
"Parasite."
"Forgive me if I don't grieve."
 "Reyna, there are better ways to survive than your path."
"Oh I'm so ashamed. Pobre de mi, how will I live with myself?"
"Sage, we are the perfect pair. You give life. I take it."
"Gentle Sage is not so gentle after all."
"Who will heal their healer?"
"Ay corazón."
"I'll send flowers."
"Skye. This is just the beginning of your power."
"Be strong, Skye."
"Sova, be a dear and find them for me."
"I'm impressed, Sova. Even with blood on your hands you're keeping control."
"Who's the hunter now?!"
"Ah, Viper, must you always play with your food?"
