"I blew you up!"
"Obliterated!"
"Boom!"
"Boom!"
"You see that?!"
"Ha, you see that?"
"Hoh, that worked great!"
"Hoh, that worked great!"
"Ah, so what'd I miss?"
"Finally back out in the field! Let's go, there's so many new toys I want to try out!"
"You can take the girl out of Salvador, but you'll never take the girl out of Salvador. Wait..."
"I promise I'll get 'em. Might take down a city block along the way but hey, a win's a win."
"Okay, minha família. Leave the fireworks to me. Should be plenty loud for you to have some fun."
"Just me, my squad-zinho, and a few tons of dynamite. There's nothing we can't do!"
"Even if I go out, I'll go out with a bang! Just promise you'll dance at my funeral, okay?"
"I shouldn't have to say this because, you know, my vibe, but, stay clear of my explosions, okay?"
"Oxe, are we in their world now, or they in ours? No, it's theirs. I got it. This universe stuff, it's complicated."
"Once we get their radianite, can I keep a little extra for my boom bot-i? Would that be cool? Honestly, I don't think anybody minds!"
"They think they can walk all over my turf?! I've got a grenade that says otherwise."
"This poor place. You used to be so beautiful. Don't worry. I'll send you off with a bang."
"Hey, uh, that glass is shatter-proof, né? Anyone test grenades on it yet? I'm just thinking out loud."
"Ugh, another Kingdom infestation. Well fine. I'll just make sure be extra collateral with my collateral damage."
"You- you say something? Ha, sorry. Ears still ringing."
"Ah, surrounded by minha família. We won't lose!"
"We're here, because we're the best! Don't any of you forget that!"
"No one beats my firepower, I got this!"
"Gear up, stay safe, we're going back in."
"Paint? Check. Charges? Check. Brakes? *chuckles* Nowhere in sight."
"None of my stuff has malfunctioned yet! Can we celebrate that?"
"They want to dance? Ha! I'll lead."
"Anyone have any splints? I may have jammed my fingers, multiple fingers."
"They're going to scatter from my stuff. Super easy to pick off."
"Okay, I only have, like, seventy-eight grenades left? Hopefully that's enough."
"And that's how we do it."
"Ha, they think we wouldn't fight back? Dead wrong."
"Let's do it again!"
"Ha! We dancing now! Let's keep it up!"
"Never had a doubt. Let's keep it going!"
"Who said this wouldn't be fun. I'm having a blast!"
"Ha! I try to stay serious here, but this is just so much fun."
"This party's just begun."
"See? They're stubborn, but they'll break."
"Okay, they tried. Now it's our turn."
"Spend those creds before we lose them."
"Spend those creds before we lose them."
"Party's over. Let's show them out!"
"One last fight, everyone. We can do it!"
"Uh, where's the spike?"
"I think we need the spike."
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm saving."
"I'm saving."
"Anyone need something?"
"Anyone need something?"
"Can I get a drop?"
"Can I get a drop?"
"They can't even make a dent!"
"Tear them down."
"Stay out of my home."
"We set the tempo, not them."
"Just let loose."
"Let's go, keep it up!"
"We'll come back. I can feel it."
"We'll bring it back."
"Gotta find that rhythm."
"Shake them up."
"Vamos, gente!"
"Ha! They don't have a chance."
"Let's start this party."
"I need to blow something up."
"Time to explode."
"Let's flush them out."
"Let's make 'em dance!"
"Let's make some chaos."
"Come on, let's go!"
"Ha! Got one!"
"Boom!"
"Next."
"Get out of here!"
"Woo!"
"One down."
"Snuffed out."
"Tchau!"
"See ya!"
"Got 'em."
"Nailed it."
"Precision kill."
"Headshot."
"Loosen up!"
"Dropped."
"Ouch!"
"Didn't waste my ammo."
"Take a nap."
"Three for me."
"Three for me."
"Ha, four."
"Ha, four."
"Woo! Okay, take a break guys!"
"Last bogey killed."
"I think that's it."
"Okay, done!"
"Okay! Who's got the snacks?"
"I'm as quiet as a mouse."
"The bigger they are, the harder they fall."
"Let's dance!"
"Let's dance!"
"Pfft, like you could stop me."
"I defuse things in my sleep."
"I defuse things in my sleep."
"Impressive wiring."
"Impressive wiring."
"Ah, shame, I love explosions."
"Talk about collateral damage! Ha!"
"Bring it! Me against the world!"
"Don't mess with this Baiana."
"Woohoo! I'm the pride of Bahia!"
"Ha! I could've beaten twice the number!"
"Haha! Let's keep it going!"
"Ah, now that was a work of art!"
"Ah, meus amores, we live another day!"
"Ah, that was fun! Do you think they had fun?"
"Ugh, I'm still here, amigo."
"All I need is spare parts."
"Ah, smells like victory, and gunpowder."
"There we go! Nice work, everyone!"
"Gente! As colorful as Carnaval!"
"Ha! Look at this wreckage! I'm so proud!"
"Aí sim, we rock! But seriously, when can we hit up the club here?"
"The city is safe! Or, you know, what's left of it. Never said I was perfect."
"Gente! As colorful as Carnaval!"
"Woohoo! I'm the pride of Bahia!"
"Hey, I'll take it."
"Next time, número um."
"I still get a trophy, right?"
"Astra, how did you even do that?! Man, where do I sign up for lessons?"
"That enemy Astra thinks she knows everything. Let's bring her back down to Earth."
"Breach! Lindo! Your arms are looking great! You need a tuneup?"
"You know, Breachy, in all this chaos it would be terrible if some equipment just, got lost, you know?"
 "Oh man, just awful. A tragedy."
"Breach, you're practically dancing! You ready to go, lindo?"
"Did you see Breach back there? That's how it's done."
"Breach! Bra jobbatch! Did I say that right?" *mumbles mispronunciations*
"Vamos, Breach. Let's go!"
"I don't have any history with that fake Breachy. Screw him. I'll put him down."
"Huh, sorry mano."
"Brimstone, that bracer has access to the Kingdom mainframe, yeah? Just asking for a friend."
"Brimstone, chefinho! Thanks for the paint canisters, ha, best gift ever!"
"You bet, and don't use them all in one day."
"Brimstone-zinho, you sure I can't listen to music? You're really bringing me down here, man!"
"Someone track down their Brimstone. Cut off the head of the snake."
"That Brimstone's just sparks!"
"Chamber, let me borrow one of your guns! Please? Ah, come on man, please? I said please."
"Come back with a bigger gun."
"That Cypher wants to watch us? Let him, we don't hide!"
"Jett! My sister from another mister. Let's have some fun, yeah?"
"Olha, Jett, I can't wait for you to run circles around them!"
"Damn Jett! You're kicking ass!"
"Their Jett is nothing compared to ours. Let's crush that copy."
"Jett's grounded."
"KAY/O, level with me. Is there anything you can't do out here?"
 "Uh, sneak past a metal detector. First thing that comes to mind.""
"Hey, other KAY/O, put a shirt on!"
"Killjoy! Thanks for letting me borrow your Alarmbot. It's so much better with explosions! Why did you never try that?"
"Killjoy, gatinha, there's no one else I'd rather fight beside, or dance with."
"Killjoy, after this you wanna do some tinkering?"
 "Sure, but if anything explodes again, you are telling Brim."
"Killjoy, don't overthink it! Sometimes, you just need to hit them with explosives."
"Killjoy. You and me until the end."
"Engineer killed."
 "Oy, Raze? Raze! Ugh, 'di bale na."
"Wait, what? I'm listening to music, let me just- you say something? What did she say?"
"Neon, holy shit, you guys see that?! Gata can move!"
"Neon, let's go, go, go!"
"Omen, thank goodness you're on our side! Ai, great work, amigo!"
"I got their Omen."
"Got their Omen."
"Nightmare's over."
"Phoenix, you're a star! Get it? Haha! ... Okay, I'm sorry."
"I'll burn brighter than their Phoenix. Just watch me."
"Another Raze?! Ha! I bet she's fun! I mean, I'll still kill her, obviously."
"That Raze has some good invenções. Would love to pick them apart."
"That Raze sucks!"
"Killed my copy."
"Am I really that loud?"
"Sleep well, meu amorzinho."
"Reyna, meu amor. What happened? Who hurt you?"
"When Reyna gets started it's hard to stop her. I'd like to avoid that, please."
"Damn, Sage, you do everything. Why are the rest of us even here?"
"I got their Sage. She builds walls, I tear them down. No problem."
"Sage's walls are coming down!"
"Skye's out."
"Sova, you listen to the weirdest music. Lots of duntz-duntz-duntz-duntz-duntz. How do you dance to it?"
"Hunter hunted! Ha!"
"Viper, you gotta let loose! Let's go out after this! Girls night, woop-woop!"
"Let's go, Viper."
"That snake lady is a joke. Brazil has real vipers. She's dumb."
