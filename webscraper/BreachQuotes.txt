"Stand in my way. I dare you."
"Clearing out!"
"Blasting!"
"Flash out!"
"Blinding!"
"Concussing!"
"Tremor!"
"Let's go!"
"Off your feet!"
"Hehe, of course you still need me."
"Guns in my face? Just another Tuesday."
"Nothing fancy, uh? We go in, we crush them, we get out."
"The faster we do this, the faster I get paid."
"We treat this like any other job. No more, no less."
"They're not intimidating, they're stupid. Big difference."
"Been pulling jobs like this for years. Risky? Sure. But never boring."
"I don't need these arms to fight, but they're fun. Might as well use 'em."
"These cowards aren't ready for me. No one ever is."
"Look at this place! Kingdom has more money than they know what to do with! I wonder where they keep it."
"They think they're so secure."
"If you're not being shot at you're doing something wrong!"
"I'll do my job, you do yours."
"Trust me, they'll know what hit 'em."
"We doing this or what?"
"Come on! Get me in the line of fire."
"They think they're better than us. I can tell."
"Time to take these arms for a spin."
"They're not getting the message. Leave it to me, I'll rough them up."
"Just swapping in new fusion cells. Okay, my arms are good! We can go."
"I hate waiting. Let's do this!"
"Oh yeah, there's the adrenaline."
"I've been itching for a fight."
"You see an insect, you crush it."
"You flinch, you lose."
"Push 'em 'til they break!"
"Keep them off balance!"
"They can run, or get run over. Their choice."
"They don't get to surrender, keep swinging!"
"This isn't a fight, it's stealing lunch money."
"I'm done playing."
"Their crew got sloppy. Punish them."
"The fools gave us a window. Smash through it!"
"Spend what you got."
"No point saving. Spend it all."
"We got them beat. Knock 'em out!"
"Let's put them in the ground."
"Let's finish this already!"
"Where the hell's the spike?"
"Too eager! Forgot the spike."
"Buying."
"Buying."
"Saving."
"Saving."
"I'm feeling generous. Who needs a buy?"
"I'm feeling generous. Who needs a buy?"
"I need a drop."
"I need a drop."
"Break through!"
"Enough."
"They want a fight? Let's fight."
"I don't have all day."
"Stomp 'em!"
"Attack us, come on!"
"Hit them back!"
"I take what I want."
"Punch in."
"Crush them."
"Keep up the pressure."
"Mow 'em down!"
"Behind me."
"Let's have some fun."
"Don't let up."
"I'm ready."
"Keep up!"
"Hit them fast, hit them hard."
"Take 'em."
"Dead."
"Dead."
"Too late!"
"Too late."
"Worthless!"
"Pitiful."
"Gotchu."
"Weak."
"Dusted."
"Amateur."
"Hejd√•."
*laughs*
"Ha!"
"Popped!"
"Headshot."
"You're nothing."
"No match."
"Easy!"
"Night-night."
"Gutted!"
"Three out!"
"Three out!"
"Make it four."
"Make it four!"
"Not one left."
"Ha!"
"We bring enough body bags?"
"Quit your tiptoeing. They're all dead."
"Kill everyone, and our job gets a whole lot easier."
"Never been in a knife fight, have you?"
"I fight dirty."
"In a fair fight I'd still kill you."
"No one beats me! No one."
"Game time!"
"Game time!"
"Get off my back."
"Get off my back."
"Shut up and let me work."
"Shut up and let me work."
"Come on, come on."
"Come on, come on."
"Not your day, is it."
"Change of plans."
"I'm in overdrive!"
"I'll run through you every damn time!"
"I'm firing on all cylinders!"
"Anyone else want to try me?!"
"You're pathetic!"
"What the hell were the rest of you doing?!"
"Stay out of my way."
"I go through anyone!"
"My rate just went up!"
"Is that the best you've got?"
"Always got to overprove myself!"
"Doubt me again!"
"Child's play!"
"We ran right over them!"
"Hell yeah! Next drink's on me."
"I could've left my arms at home."
"Takes more than that."
"Ungh...I've taken worse."
"I don't have to pack heavy. These arms are heavy enough."
"I'm here to make money, not spend it."
"Hell yeah! Who's up for another?"
"Time to go home. Scrape these bugs off my boots."
"The fight is over? I just warmed up!"
"Job's done! Pay up."
"Oh, I've missed the cold! This was great!"
"I always do the heavy lifting!"
"Maybe now you'll take me seriously."
"My rate just went up!"
"Always got to overprove myself!"
"Good take. Next one I'll take it all!"
"I got robbed!"
"Hell yeah, let's go again!"
"A second Breach, huh? Huh, this might be a fair fight after all!"
"Nice try."
"You're just a pretender."
"It could be worse, Brimstone! Instead of working together we could be facing off! Or maybe you'd prefer that."
"Brimstone, the corporate sellout! Here to look out for Kingdom's special interests?""You don't know what you're talking about, Breach."
"You don't know what you're talking about, Breach."
"Leave some fight for the rest of us, old man!"
"I hope you're ready, old man!"
"Haha, when that Brimstone sees me here, he's gonna be so pissed!"
"That Brimstone better stay out of my way."
"That Brimstone can't stop me."
"Retired."
"See, you're not too stubborn to die. You're just stubborn enough."
"Don't aim that camera at me, Cypher! Save it for the enemy."
"Cypher, stop bugging my gear with microphones! You're worse than Interpol!"
"Where are they, Cypher?"
"Killed the rat!"
"Didn't see me coming."
"Damn, Jett, have you ever considered a life of crime? I have contacts. Let me know."
"Killjoy, your inventions are too fragile. See these arms? Carbon steel with titanium plating! That's what you need!"
"So the German has some fancy toys. Let's break them!"
"I'll make that Killjoy cry!"
"Nerd!"
"Okay Omen, I'll smash in the front door while you sneak in the back. It's a good plan, yeah?"
"Omen! That scared the shit out of me!"
"I'm gonna run my fist through that Omen's face. Can you even punch a ghost? Who cares, I'm doing it!"
"Freak!"
"You got fire in your eyes, Phoenix. I like that."
"Phoenix keeps bringing the fire, it's like a Viking funeral!"
*laughs* "Phoenix, burn 'em down."
"Let that Phoenix run his mouth. We'll shut him up soon enough."
"Raze! Huh, together again and we're not even breaking the law!"
"You know, Breachy, in all this chaos it would be terrible if some equipment just, got lost, you know?"
"Oh man, just awful. A tragedy."
"Raze, don't wreck this place all on your own! Hehe, save some demo for me!"
""Mandou bem", Raze! How's that for pronunciation, huh?"
*laughs*("Nice job, Raze! How's that for pronunciation, huh?")("Nice job, Raze! How's that for pronunciation, huh?") "It's you and me, Raze."
"Reyna, I think I'm in love!"
*laughs* "The enemy Sage thinks she will slow us down. Haha! That's cute."
"That monk thinks she's an angel. Let's clip her wings."
"Their Sage is a coward hiding behind walls. Grow a spine already!"
"I'll destroy their Sage!"
"The angel's dead."
"Breach, I'm thinking I'll hit the gym later. You in?"
"So long as it's leg day!" *laughs* 
*laughs* "Just tell me where they are, Sova. I'll take it from there."
"If that Sova thinks an arrow will stop me, he's got another thing coming - my fist!"
*laughs* "That pretty boy Sova sure looks the hero, I'll give him that. I'll still kill him."
"That Sova's mine."
"Sova's dead."
"You never stop fighting, Viper. No matter what."
"Viper, you're enjoying this a little too much."
"It was never personal, Viper. Just business."
