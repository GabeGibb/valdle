"Alright! Where's the fight?"
"Healing over here."
"Healing over here."
"Heal up, squad!"
"Heal up, squad!"
"Out o' healing."
"Out of healing."
"Time to hunt."
"Time to hunt."
"They're concussed."
"They're concussed."
"Got 'em."
"Got 'em."
"Ha! Wild!"
"Ha! Wild!"
"Good boy!"
"Good boy!"
"Scout destroyed."
"Scout destroyed."
"Hawk out."
"Hawk out."
"Blinded."
"Blinded."
"Good bird!"
"Good bird!"
"Seek them out!"
"I've got your trail!"
"Found one!"
"Found one."
"There's another!"
"There's another!"
"Three for three!"
"Three for three!"
"Wait. This feels different."
"Remember everyone, if we survive, woodworking class tonight in the mess hall. Nimble hands, nimble minds."
"Not used to working with humans. Usually just me and my pack. I guess it's worse if you guys get shot, yeah?"
"Okay, let's get going. This work won't take care of itself."
"Anyone I catch slacking off has to join my morning run tomorrow. Wake up's at four, sound good?"
"Everyone good if my pets run around out here? I don't do leashes. Should be alright."
"Game faces team, those defenders will make us work for it."
"Let's get this spike down, and get the hell away from the blast. I'd rather not die to our own tech."
"They crossed the line coming here. This ain't their world, it's ours."
"If they detonate that thing, this place is done for. I'd say our world's been through enough, yeah?"
"I can feel what this place used to be. It's dying! What a damn shame."
"Those flowers are massive! Who grew these? Them and me, we gotta link up."
"I'm no doctor, but I can patch a bullet hole or two. Let me know if you need healing."
"If you see one of my creatures, it's a good thing, alright? You'll figure out what they do eventually."
"Just some good old hard yakka, standing in between us and victory."
"These parasites aren't gonna take one step past this place."
"I feel something over there. Can't place it. Like us, but, different."
"Another fight? Clean slate! Let's leave whatever happened, in the past."
"We move as a unit, okay? Last thing I need is some hero messing things up."
"Make sure to follow my pack in. They'll lead us right to the enemy."
"We know what we're doing. Trust each other and we'll be fine."
"Don't sit down! We're not done yet."
"No wukkas, mate! Just keep it up."
"Keep that fire, yeah?"
"Keep that focus. More o' that, and we're outta here!"
"That's a good run."
"We're going off like a cut snake!"
*laughs* "Well I reckon morale's gonna be pretty low over there."
"Stay keen. They don't have to be good to be dangerous."
"They think they put us in the dirt! They're gonna find out we weren't buried! Just planted."
"There's the toehold. Now just dig in and climb up."
"Now we're on the right path. Let's keep going!"
"Don't save anything. Last chance to use our stuff."
"Don't save anything. Last chance to use our stuff."
"One more. Then first shout's, on me!"
"Come on, squad. Gotta play that whistle!"
"Well, I mean someone's gotta grab the spike, right?"
"Look, I know I didn't grab the spike, but none of you did either! So it's not just my fault."
"I'm gonna buy."
"I'm gonna buy."
"I'm gonna save this time."
"I'm gonna save this time."
"Who needs something?"
"Who needs somethin'?"
"Help a girl out, would ya?"
"Help a girl out, would you?"
"We're not equals. Let's go!"
"Shut and lock the door."
"Let's get this win."
"We gotta get our land back."
"Pull your socks up!"
"They can't get an inch!"
"Don't let me down now, yeah?"
"Let's go for the throat."
"Keep them out."
"Push them out."
"Don't give them ground!"
"I got yous, okay?"
"Time to mobilize my pack."
"Find the weak point, and break it."
"Ended."
"Enough."
"One less."
"Finished."
"Sleep tight."
"One down."
"Buried."
"One dead."
"Out."
"Taken out."
"Look at that."
"Dropped."
"Knocked 'em."
"Piss off!"
"Done with."
"Headshot."
"Night!"
"Didn't think I was that quiet!"
"That's three."
"That's three."
"Four down."
"Four down."
"No drama."
"We're done here."
"That's the last of 'em."
"I think that's it."
"That's done. Quick break."
"Well that's a knife."
"See? Not that scary."
"Last one!"
"Last one!"
"Nice try, mate."
"Nice try, mate."
"Why did I sign up for this shit?"
"Why did I sign up for this shit?"
"Don't even start that shit here, mate!"
"I can feel it. I can be so much more!"
"How did I get this powerful?!"
"Don't even try me."
"Ah, now there's some serenity."
"In the words of our Sova, "the pack survives"!"
"Now this, is a team. You see that?"
"You beauts. That's what I like to see!"
"Shit, ugh, I'm buggered."
"I'll crab walk next time. Make it easier for ya."
"And that's full time! Good stuff!"
"Come bother me again when you're trying."
"Reap what you sow."
"Anyone up for a cuppa at Cypher's place? Wherever that is."
"Just leave me here! This place is great!"
"How did I get this powerful?!"
"Nothing wrong with 'at!"
"Strong finish. Could be even stronger."
"Chin up, that was good!"
"Astra, those guys must hate you."
"Breach, you big beaut, get up here. The front line's got room for one more animal."
"Breach, I'm thinking I'll hit the gym later. You in?""So long as it's leg day!"
*laughs*  "So long as it's leg day!"
*laughs* "You decided to show off a little, eh Breach?"
"You and me, Breach. Let's go!"
"Shame their Breach is against us! I really need a gym buddy."
"Brimstone, you old dog! I respect that you've still got some bite! If you break a hip out there, I got you covered."
"There's a Brimstone over there. That man's a fossil! Put 'im in the ground where he belongs."
"Brimstone down."
"Cypher, I knew you were a legend from the start. Great work mate!"
"That Fade's got demons. It's gonna take more than fresh air to clear her head."
"Fade's a goner."
"Harbor, whatever stunts you're planning today, count me in."
 "You know I will! Can't pull a गंगा double without the double."
 "One look at our muscle man Harbor here and those baddies are gonna piss themselves."
"Harbor, you can stop pouring water on your arms. Those cannons shine enough already. Don't be vain."
"Harbor, you weapon! I love it."
"See ya, buddy!"
"Sorry bud, that's game."
 "Skye. Ever though thought about making other summons? Like, uh, lions. Or, ooh, dragons!"
"Tried once. It was, not pretty."
"Jett, don't slow down for us. My creatures move fast, they'll keep up."
"Jett, you little ripper, that was insane! Keep it up, love!"
"I bet their Jett thinks she's all that. Well news flash, girlie. No one wins alone! I'll take her and her team down."
"That Killjoy thinks a few bots will keep her safe? Give me a break!"
"What's so special about that Killjoy's tech? I've got visual sensors too. They're called eyes!"
"Great inventions. I'm so impressed."
"Omen all that slinking around makes you hard to track. Glad you're on my side, eh?"
"Omen, when you teleport, I don't know. Sometimes, I lose you. Does that make sense?"
"Omen, you monster! I mean it in a good way, I swear."
"Killed their Omen."
"Phoenix, you're killing it out there!"
"Come on, Raze, you cheeky bugger. 't's get into 'em!"
"Raze, I love the destruction! Just keep it on their side, yeah?"
"If that Raze breaks one more thing..."
"Reyna, I know that look. I've lost people too. Let's do this for them."
"Reyna, still hungry? I'm sure my pets can chase out some game for ya."
"Reyna that was savage! How d'you learn to hunt like that?!"
"Reyna, take 'em all down."
"I'll keep my soul, thank you."
"Sage, I'll teach you how to control my seekers if you teach me how to raise the dead. Fair trade I reckon."
"Everyone give Sage a break! Crying over every bruise. I'm here! You can bother me."
"Sage, let's keep everyone alive."
"You made this happen, Sage."
"Two of us?! *laughs* This place is gonna be a zoo!"
"I got their Aussie!"
"There can only be one Aussie around here."
"If that Sova's arrows come anywhere near my pack? He's dead!"
"That Sova's gonna put his eye out with all that tech. Mhm. His other eye I mean."
"Leave that Sova to me."
"I can't believe their Viper's dumping all that shit in the air. I'll kill her!"
"Careful of the Viper!"
"No more Viper."
 "Hey, flower girl. I found some leaves. Do you want them?"
"I've got enough, thanks. But call me flower girl again, I'll break your nose."
"Wow, someone wants attention."
"Rift walker's dead."
