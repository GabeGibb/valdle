"Nothing stays hidden from me. Nothing."
"They found my wire."
"Tripwire destroyed."
"Caught one!"
"Found you."
"Careful now."
"Cage triggered."
"Got you."
"Tagged."
"Camera taken out."
"Camera taken out."
"My camera is destroyed."
"Ah, my eyes are down."
"Oh, this is a nice spot!"
"Yes, this should do."
"This goes here."
"That goes there."
"Where is everyone hiding?"
"I know exactly where you are!"
"Give me a corpse!"
"For a moment, I saw them!"
"They're scared. I don't need cameras to see that."
"Nobody escapes me. But they'll try."
"I wonder if they have any parts I can salvage. Hmm, implants? I need those!"
"Ah, okay, this is good! I've got new gadgets to try out."
"I must survive to protect my family. I can't lose them. I can't feel that pain again."
"Let's see what I have to use. Pictures of their children? Wow, way too dark."
"I will stop anyone who tries to come through. I must keep my secrets with me."
"The back alleys, or the streets of war. There is no difference. Just nicer toys."
"I'm prepared to die for this mission, though I'd really rather not."
"It's decided. Their radianite belongs to us, you see? No ethical dilemma. مش مُشكِل."
"Think of it this way. The more radianite we take from them, the less I borrow from all of you. Extra incentive."
"These impostors threaten everything! Nora, نقدرش نخليهم يخسروا الغزال ديالي."
"I detect an incursion into our world? Hah, no, the other team is just very noisy!"
"What has Kingdom done to this town?! However pretty their lies are, they're just sucking my city dry!"
"Imagine all the information once kept here, lost in seconds! Ah, خسارة!"
"Ah, I've always wanted to pry my way in here. Don't mind if I just leave some... gifts behind."
"They're usually distracted once I reveal them. Make sure you take advantage."
"Where will they go this time?"
"One of my cameras is broken!- Oh, wait, okay. It's fine."
"They will scurry, and then they will die."
"I can't see them yet. But I can feel them getting ready."
"Give me a moment. I need to set back up."
"If they try something, I'll see it."
"Will they try the same old tricks?"
"We know more than we did before. Let's use that."
"I find them, I kill them. Simple as that."
"Now remember, wipe the prints from your guns. It's just good crime scene etiquette."
"They're on the back foot, let's deliver another blow!"
"An injured dog bites hard. Careful."
"Good work, friends! Keep using my vision to your advantage."
"Find them again. Kill them again."
"We're doing good. Let's do better. Just for fun."
"Blink, and they'll catch up. Stay alert."
"Wonderful! It's great to see how frightened they are."
"Let us use our sight to our advantage."
"Don't worry. The house always wins."
"Their confidence begins to crack. أنا شفته, ah, I can see it."
"We lose all our money after this. Might as well use it."
"Spend like there is no tomorrow! Because there just might not be."
"Nothing will be saved after this. Use it."
"I saw their desperation. Let's use that."
"Let's close up shop. I have things to do."
"Are we going to get the spike?"
"The spike is still in base."
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm saving."
"I'm saving."
"I have money if you need."
"I have money if you need."
"I need this."
"I need this."
"They have nowhere to hide."
"Let me find you again."
"Don't get cozy."
"That radianite must be ours!"
"We must keep them out."
"My eyes will tip the balance."
"I will find them."
"Let's knock them down!"
"My intel is their obstacle."
"They crash against our wall."
"We must shore up our defenses!"
"I must weave my web better."
"I will find you."
"I will find you."
"Okay. Let's get set up."
"We, will reveal their secrets."
"Where are you?"
"Now, where to set up shop?"
"يلا مشينا."
"No hard feelings."
"Put down."
"Ouch."
"Enemy down."
"Hostile removed."
"Buried."
"One down."
"Foolish."
"One dead."
"Goodbye."
"تهلّى."
"ب السلامة."
"Headshot."
"My eyes are better than yours."
"Eagle-eyed."
"Deleted."
"Trick shot."
"Erased."
"Knock knock."
"صاحبي اسكت"
"Only I could see you hide. Don't worry."
"I saw you scurry."
"You were probably afraid."
"Three out of five."
"Three out of five."
"Four out of five."
"Four out of five."
"Oops, no one to interrogate!"
"Squashed the last bug."
"Wiped clean."
"Okay, time for a break."
"Okay, they're dead. Take what's useful."
"You should have been looking more closely."
"I am Prometheus! And you are just a god."
"I saw your secrets. They made you weak."
"One rat left."
"One rat left."
"Don't interrupt!"
"Don't interrupt!"
"This is no problem."
"This is no problem."
"Spike defused."
"You're dead, and I didn't feel anything. Not even a thrill."
"Ah, you forget. I've always been a killer."
"You copies are nothing."
"You forget. I always play high stakes."
"You guys are so much better than my last team!"
"They were blind."
*laughs* "No one left to send a message? Oh well"
"Nora, I will see you again."
"Ugh, I hate visiting underground doctors."
"I'll try to be even more poor next time. It'll be hard, hmm, but I'll try."
"You think I don't know how to get by without money?"
"Ah, so much learned this day. A victory, on many fronts."
"Never come back. I will take you apart!"
"My truths stay hidden for one day more."
"You're lucky I'm generous. Or else your families would be next."
"I knew your every move. It was sad watching you scamper."
"Back to my workshop. Still much to be done."
"Get out of my city!"
"I knew your every move. It was sad watching you scamper."
"I am Prometheus! And you are just a god."
"Never come back. I will take you apart!"
"I say that was a good job."
"That was good. But next time, first place."
"That was fun! Again?"
"Breach, Breach. I took a servo from your arms, for my tripwire, don't be angry. Breach."
"Breach breached, hah."
"Let me see if I can hack into that Brimstone's bracer. If he's anything like our Brimstone, he won't know how to fix it!"
*laughs* "Retire their Brimstone."
"With me, Chamber. Your eyes, my cameras. We make a good team."
"Be mindful of their Chamber. He does not miss much."
"Now where did Chamber build his nest?"
"I honestly don't know who the Cypher on their side is. *sighs* A real mystery."
"Who are you? Copy of me? *laughs* Where did you come from?"
"Who will see better, Amir?"
"I'll crush your eyes, Amir."
"أيوه سلام عليك"
"There can only be one."
*laughs* "Ah, Fade, سلام. I would offer you a camera, but your methods for gathering intel are a little less traditional."
"Fade, of all people, you've never asked to see my face.""There are more valuable secrets than the look of someone. Will you share those?"
"There are more valuable secrets than the look of someone. Will you share those?"
"Fade, keep those nightmares away from me. I already have bad dreams."
*laughs* "معلمه. Who would have thought the nightmare lady would be so scary."
"Fade, leave their brains intact."
"Exercise caution around their Fade. Not the type you want to meet in a dark alley."
"Now I can rest a little easier."
"Fly, my wind assassin. Do what you do best."
"That wind girl is so jumpy! So annoying! My poor tripwires."
"No more running, girl."
"Cypher, can you show me round the dark web one of these days?"
"Oh, oh dear no sweetheart! We must protect you."
"Little engineer! I borrowed one of your transmitters for my camera. I'll pay you back! Probably."
"Killjoy, do you have your soldering iron on you? I want it- um, I me- I mean, I-I need it."
"Let's go, little engineer."
"Omen! I have the information you asked for. But my price! My price hasn't been paid yet."
"Goodbye to you, and your secrets."
"Phoenix! Our little star, keep that furnace burning, okay?"
"Phoenix, woah. You are really aggressive, I'm impressed! And a little scared."
"Go, Phoenix. Burn!"
"Fire's out."
"No rebirth for you."
"Ah Raze, don't tinker with my gadgets! I don't need exploding cameras again! *sighs* The cleanup was so messy."
"Raze, you powder keg. Nice work!"
"Blow them away, Raze."
"Reyna, jeez! Leave some for the rest of us! Or don't! *laughs nervously* I'm-I-I am sorry."
"Remember everyone, she can only suck our souls after we die. What a charming woman."
"Reyna killed."
"So, Sage. You can bring people back from the dead? Anyone? No constraints? Interesting."
"Sage. Keep me alive. I still have things to do."
"I will kill their healer. It's the only way to keep them all dead."
"Healer killed."
"Wait wait wait! Do I have the definition of hippie wrong? Because that certainly wasn't peaceful!"
"Between you and me, Sova? There's nowhere they can hide! *chuckles* How fun!"
"Sova, I accessed your background file, a good story! But that's not really how you lost your eye."
"And your file is missing, Amir. Explain that."
"Ah, Sova. My measured friend, that was amazing!"
"Their Sova will see what I want him to see."
"Let's blind their scout."
"Viper, who's birthday is March 20th? I found it when, uh- *chuckles* okay, okay. I have everyone's passwords."
"You know, Viper, the name Sabine really fits you."
"Never call me that again! If you do though it's Doctor Sabine, get it right."
"Viper. You're channeling that fury into real power. Keep it up."
"Their Viper's poison is not just physical, it's psychological as well. Keep strong."
"Poison's gone."
"Wow. You are cool! Like, really! Are you even sweating?"
"Remember, the rift walker is over there. Never think you're safe."

"Quiet!"
