"You have good taste, my friend."
"That's a good spot."
"A gift."
"That works."
"I have them."
"There they are!"
"They found my trap."
"Trap destroyed."
"Adieu."
"Parfait!"
"Excusez-moi!"
"Teleport's ready."
"Teleport's ready."
"Out of range."
"Out of range."
"I'm too far."
"I'm too far."
"Farewell."
"Away!"
"Goodbye!"
"Teleport's gone."
"Teleport's broken."
"They are so dead!"
"You want to play? Let's play."
"Oh I like it!"
"Oh I'm enjoying this!"
"Beautiful!"
"I love this gun!"
"This is too fun!"
"That was unpleasant."
"Do not worry, with me this will be easy. C'est simple comme bonjour."
"Okay, last looks. You all look wonderful. Me, I always look good, we are ready."
"If you die today, I will remember you forever. It has been an honor."
"None of this "a win is a win" nonsense. We should win big and look good doing it."
"This killing is terrible business but I always say if I must do something, be the best."
"Ah, we've been noticed! Follow my lead, I know how to make an entrance."
"I must say I like what they have done with the place."
"Our guests have arrived. Let's make a good first impression, shall we?"
"Oh no, invaders here to take our radianite!" *laughs* "I'm sorry, let's go shoot them."
"Be careful near the ship, that portal does not work as intended. Such a bad investment."
"It is sad what happened here, such a terrible accident, one that I had nothing to do with."
"It seems these strangers want me dead. Eh bien, they're not the first."
"Trust me, they will make mistakes. When they do, take advantage."
"If you're not doing well, keep trying. We must keep up appearances."
"Okay, which gun to pick this time?"
"One bullet per enemy, that should be enough, yes?"
"Weapon choice, it is so personal, non? You pick a gun and it tells me who you are."
"Take aim, then fire, let's not complicate it."
"Let us see what they have planned for us this time."
"These guns we use are okay but I will also bring my own. No offense."
"These new friends of ours are not too friendly."
"Please do not mistake my smile. I take this all very seriously."
"I do like winning."
"They revealed their weaknesses. Not smart."
"One step closer."
"That was good! Another round, yes?"
"Surely they can do better."
"They are no match, though I cannot say I'm surprised."
"I thought I would have to work today. Clearly not."
"This is just the beginning."
"That was good but there is more to do. On n'est pas sorti de l'auberge."
"Now they are nervous."
"Buy the best guns you can."
"Spend everything, don't be cheap."
"This has gone on long enough I think."
"Time to say goodbye."
"I think we should also bring the spike."
"Mesdames, messieurs, the spike!"
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm going to save."
"I'm going to save."
"I can buy for you, my treat."
"I can buy for you, my treat!"
"Does anyone have funds?"
"Does anyone have funds?"
"Keep your eye on target."
"Kick them out."
"Find a way through them."
"Get them out of here."
"Okay, start fresh."
"I've done more with less, keep fighting."
"It feels like we've won already."
"They should give up now."
"Now, they have my attention."
"Have a good time out there."
"They are making this simple."
"Let's dance."
"Focus now, eyes off me."
"Bonne chance, mes amis."
"Who will I spot first?"
"In we go."
"Too slow!"
"Not your best!"
"Next!"
"One less!"
"So close!"
"Do better!"
"I don't think so!"
"You lose!"
"Away with you!"
"I win again!"
"That one's dead."
"Terminus."
"Aïe!"
"I can't miss!"
"I'm a good shot!"
"So long!"
"Embarrassing!"
"Stand aside!"
"That's three."
"And four!"
"It's a shame you had to die, but you are not part of my bigger picture."
"I would apologize to them but alas, they are dead."
"Oh, I am not cleaning this up."
"Okay, quick break."
"I am sorry we could not work out our differences."
*laughs* "I'm sorry, but I could not help myself"
"Was that their best? How embarrassing."
"One more!"
"One more!"
"Excuse me I'm working."
"No one else could do this?"
"This is less than ideal."
"They didn't actually think that would work."
"No fireworks today I'm afraid."
"Oh thank you, thank you, you are too kind."
"I really am fantastic."
"Did you enjoy the show?" *laughs* "Of course you did."
"How do I get away with these things?"
"Did everyone see that?"
"Did you see their faces? Sorry, I should not laugh."
"Bravo, you all did beautifully!"
"How did they think this would end?"
"Well, this suit is ruined."
"Take their guns, vite!"
"This was fun! We should do it again."
"You were in my way so this was inevitable."
"It has been a pleasure, my friends. Au revoir!"
"Goodbye paradise, and good riddance."
"I should go, before someone recognizes me."
"Okay, they win this round."
"Pretty good."
"I was right there."
"Pardon, monsieur."
"Astra, it is delightful to see you. I am at your service, mademoiselle."
"Astra, what can I say? Je reste sans voix, I am speechless!"
"Good luck, Astra."
"Let's see what their Astra can do."
"Astra's gone."
"Please Brimstone, I am your key to the other side, you should at least pretend to like me."
"Who is that well-dressed man on the other side? Ah, the other me. Of course."
"Do not let my double shoot you, you will die."
"So, we have to kill my double? So be it."
"No loose ends."
"Au revoir, frérot."
"You knew not to trust me."
"Oh our deal? It's over. Sorry for the late notice."
"Be careful with my secrets, Cypher. It is better I think if we stay friends."
"Tell me what you have learned, Cypher- oh sorry, I meant us, please tell us."
"Cypher, incroyable, you never cease to impress!"
"Does that Cypher know how valuable his secrets are? I should be careful."
"Their Cypher knows too much."
"Cypher, I'm sorry it has come to this."
"KAY/O, you are so industrial, it's a good look, but if you need something more upscale I have many ideas."
"Bien joué KAY/O, you are unstoppable my friend."
"KAY/O, take them out."
"Do not worry my radiant friends. I will unplug their talking toaster."
"Toaster is broken!"
"Killjoy, I could never wear that jacket but on you, superb.""Chamber! I'm ready for some custom guns. You'll hook me up, yeah?"
*chuckles* "I am sorry, Phoenix, you cannot afford me."
*chuckles* "I am sorry, Phoenix, you cannot afford me."
"Reyna, I must say how nice it is to work with you. It is so hard to find partners with your...experience."
"Reyna, what you just did, je n'en reviens pas, I cannot believe it!"
"After you, Reyna."
"Sova, now here is a man of principle! But you have broken rules before, yes? Ah, of course you have."
"Did you all see Sova?! Impressionnant, this man knows what he's doing!"
"Viper, don't pretend you're not happy to see me. You're smiling on the inside, I know it."
"Viper, you must let me take you out some time. Dinner, dancing, I know the perfect place."
"Chamber, I would rather drink my own poison."
"Bonjour, Yoru. Your sunny demeanor is blinding as always."
"Beau travail, Yoru! You humble me."

"Quiet now!"

"Ah, the other Astra. If she dies, take that metal arm for me would you? Merci."
"Now, let's take a look at this hand of yours."
"Monsieur Brimstone, as promised I have found your next recruit. You are off the hook, as they say. Forgive me for doing your job!"
"Zippy Jett needs some competition I think. I know just the person."
"Killjoy, I hear your latest project lacks a power source. Do not be embarrassed, I have a solution."
"Reyna, radiant as always. Speaking of which, I have an impressionable young mind for you to corrupt. A gift from me to you."
"Sage, I am told you are something of a radiant mentor? Expect a new student soon. I should warn you that this one is a bit...prickly."
"Viper, your suit is a little stifling, no? When you go meet the new agent, maybe pack something light, Manila is quite warm this time of year."
