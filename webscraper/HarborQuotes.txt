"Together, we'll crush them."
"Flooding them."
"Flooding them!"
"Wave crashing."
"Wave crashing!"
"Shield going out."
"Shield going out!"
"Blocking fire."
"Blocking fire."
"Wall's up."
"Wall's up."
"Water rising."
"Water rising."
"Let's turn the tide!"
"I suggest you move!"
"Back in business!"
"Well equipped, well rested, and well fed. Couldn't ask for a better start!"
"Look at us! I've never seen a more beautiful group of heavily armed soldiers."
"I've done a thousand missions like this before. Today is no different!"
"Someone showed up to fight us. They're either stupid, or very stupid."
"चलो, let's see some excitement! It's not everyday you save the world!"
"This artifact is not my only source of strength."
"Well, this looks dangerous. Good thing we brought guns."
"They have radianite, we have a spike. Sounds like a perfect match to me!."
"Hey, let's keep that spike safe. I'm told it's terribly expensive."
"History is full of senseless aggression. Some things don't change."
"Hmph, they're still after our radianite? Ah, they get a gold star for persistence."
"The pillars on that domed building are Corinthian, the last of the three classical orders. How are you not excited?!"
"That old wall by the trees was part of a Casbah once. Still majestic after all this time."
"Who builds a neoclassical mansion in the middle of an ocean? Obnoxious."
"Will you look at those basalt columns?! You know those hexagonal shapes form naturally."
"What is a red seal ship from the Tokugawa Era doing way up here? ज़बरदस्त!"
"अरे, look at that rock-cut architecture! This city was built, um, 5th century शायद, maybe earlier."
"That castle beyond the dome dates back to 48 BC. Shame it couldn't be saved."
"See that older building? How the roof follows the silver ratio? Ahah, who said math wasn't beautiful?"
"Your mind is just as dangerous as your weapon. Use it."
"How's everyone feeling? Good? Because you look great."
"Conflict is not my first choice, but that choice was made."
"Anyone dehydrated? Need a quick rinse? Just checking."
"Occupational hazards aside, I do love how much we travel."
"Hey, loosen up. It's only life or death!"
"Sort out your gear quick, time's more precious than a bullet."
"They think they're the best until we prove them wrong."
"Take them out before they even pull the trigger."
"Move together and overwhelm them."
"No stopping now. Not until the job is done."
"Watch their movement. Study their patterns. Exploit whatever you can."
"Haha, now we're warmed up."
"If you're keeping score, that was a win."
"I'm not finished until they stop breathing."
"Excellent my friends, excellent."
"Anyone feel bad for the other team? At this point it's only natural."
"We have a good thing going, keep it up."
"Wow, we are destroying them!"
"I knew we were better than that."
"We are not so easily beaten."
"They didn't think we would give up, did they?"
"It's our last chance to attack. Buy out the shop."
"सुनो, treat yourself to something nice while you still can."
"We're so close I can taste it! Come on!"
"Now give it everything you have!"
*sighs* "Someone get the spike, please! We're professionals!"
"Can't plant the spike if we leave it here, people!"
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"Saving up."
"Saving up."
"Speak up if you need a gun."
"Speak up if you need a gun."
"Can someone spot me?"
"Can someone spot me?"
"Now we tip the scale!"
"Now roll over them!"
"Their defense needs work."
"They're not winning yet."
"Don't ease up. Not yet."
"I will set things right."
"Let's reclaim ground."
*scoffs* "Maybe they'll surprise us."
"Hey! Keep at it."
"Huh, they're pretty airtight huh?"
"Are they still trying?"
"It's not over."
"It's now or never."
"Try not to get shot, okay?"
"Stay in the moment."
"आराम से."
"Show them how we fight!"
"Hah."
"Too slow."
"चल हट."
"Hah."
"Target down."
"Kill confirmed."
"Hah."
"अलविदा."
"Stay down!"
"Got ya."
"Dropped one."
"Oof."
"Tough luck."
"Farewell."
"Headshot."
"बेचारा."
"Not today."
"Huhoo, see that?"
"That sucks."
"Not quite."
"Got three."
"Got three."
"Got four."
"Got four."
"See you in the next life."
"All targets cleared."
"And that's the last one."
"Field secured."
"Your journey ends here."
"Last target down. Didn't need a gun."
"As far as duels go, not bad."
"One more, come on!"
"One more, come on!"
"Don't worry. I didn't forget."
"And now, you have my full attention."
"The beeping is a little much."
"It could go either way."
"Yes, disaster averted."
"Okay, now we sigh with relief."
"History will forget them!"
"Looks like I got a little carried away!"
"What did they expect?!"
"What can I say? I do this for a living."
"My proximity to death really added to the fun."
"Haha, amateurs."
"Hey, would you look that? We're all still alive."
"Now, that was something."
"After this, the first round of Chai is on me."
"Not my cleanest work. But I'll take it."
*laughs* "I'm used to world class tech. But hey, I'm flexible."
"Haha! I told you we'd crush them!"
"Mission complete. शाबाश, well done!"
"What can I say? We're better."
"Well fought, people."
"All the more reason to go again."
"Hey, it was still a good match!"
"Hey Astra! Any tips for when you get an itch under the gauntlet? This bracelet is killing me.""Hey, water boy! You and me, let's show them how the scholars get it done."
"Hell yeah! As long as there's no test at the end."
"Hell yeah! As long as there's no test at the end."
"Make them see stars, Astra!"
"Astra, thanks for fighting alongside us... mere mortals."
"Astra, show them what you got!"
"Fly, my friend."
"Breach, your prosthetics are waterproof, right? Asking for a friend."
"Round of applause for Mister Top Brass!"
"And down goes the commander."
"There's a Chamber over there. Guy can't go three steps without bringing all his fancy guns."
"Fade, I've dealt with a lot of scary people, and you, are definitely my favorite."
*laughs* "This is what happens when the goth kid gets nightmare powers."
"The enemy Fade thinks we are afraid. She's right, that shit is scary!"
"Fade's mine."
"I prefer you stay out of my head, thank you."
"Yes, there is another Harbor fighting us. And yes, he also has an artifact. Mine is better."
"Dibs on their Harbor."
"Keep your relic."
"When we are at peace, I would meet you again."
"Careful around Jett, she's sharp."
"KAY/O, you've got a lot of heart. A metaphorical heart. Unless, do you have a real heart?"
"Neon! I blinked and missed that one. Do it again, huh?"
"If Neon ran faster than our bullets, then I'd be worried."
"Slow down, kid."
"अरे यार, Phoenix! Let's team up and boil these clowns."
"Phoenix, don't run in and get yourself shot, unless that's the plan."
"Phoenix, you're supposed to be all talk! What the hell happened?"
"Light them up, Phoenix!"
"Got their Phoenix!"
"You still have a long way to go, यार."
"How much ordnance does that Raze carry around? Give me a break."
"Stay sharp, you don't get a second chance in combat, unless Sage is involved."
 "Harbor, whatever stunts you're planning today, count me in."
"You know I will! Can't pull a गंगा double without the double."
"Skye, you find their trail, I'll bring them down."
"Score one for the world's most dangerous tree hugger!"
"Skye, I'm with you."
"Hang it up, buddy."
"That guy really brought a bow and arrow to a gunfight."
"Viper, just checking. You are a scientist, correct?"
"Sure, their Viper can put up a big green wall, but you know mine's prettier."
"So, Yoru, you painted over the priceless samurai mask? Huh, interesting choice."
"Keep tabs on that Yoru."
*scoffs* "Lone wolf."
