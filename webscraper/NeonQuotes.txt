"Die!"
"Dead!"
"Zapped!"
"That sucked!"
"This covert ops thing, I kind of like it. Let's not mess that up."
"Radiant powers, deadly tech. I'm sure we won't break anything."
"Let's go. World's not saving itself."
"Another site on the brink of destruction. At least we're consistent."
"Look, I'm glad you're all here. There, I said it."
"Enemies in our way? Hope they like getting hit by lightning."
"Any chance they'll let us through? Fine, we'll do it the hard way."
"Here's the plan; whatever they got, tear it down."
"They come at us, we push them back. They don't stop, we don't either."
"Huh, they came all this way. That was stupid."
"Big surprise, someone blew the fuse. No wonder you brought me."
"Hoy, fight's not over you know."
"Please stay alive, I hate making new friends."
"Listen up, kill them before they kill us."
"Remember, bullets hurt."
"Ingat ka, don't get stabbed, bad way to go."
"Get ready, I go fast."
"Fight till the end, no matter what."
"Ugh, I'm over them."
"Tara na, clock's ticking."
"Charge and shoot, easy enough."
"My advice? Don't get shot."
"Again."
"Fine, I admit it. That was nice!"
"Not bad, I could get used to that."
"They'll hit back, or at least they should."
"They're a mess over there!"
"Free target practice, I'll take it."
"I feel good! That's weird."
"I belong here. We all belong here."
"My lola was right; weeds are difficult to kill."
"Spend your cash, don't look back."
"No point saving, buy it all."
"We can all agree losing sucks, come on let's win!"
"Let's end their misery."
"They look tired, finish it!"
"Hoy! Grab the spike!"
"Really? No one got the spike?"
"Buying."
"Buying."

"Need a drop."

"Kick them out, I don't do visitors."
"Maybe they're pacifists."
"Get these losers out of here!"
"Shoot them! Always works."
"I suggest we keep winning."
"We fight to win."
"Whatever they're doing, I like it."
"Could be worse, could be better."
"Switch it up? Just for fun?"
"Tabla tayo, I'd rather win."
"Halika na, we can do this."
"Stop them please? Thank you!"
"Let's go!"
"Tch, move!"
"Tara, break's over."
"I'll show them! Lintik kayo!"
"Quick feet, quick trigger."
"Back off!"

"End of story."
"Tapos ka na! You're done!"
"Not a good look."
"That was their best, 'di ba? Not impressed."
"One more."
"One left."
"Bastos!"
"All right, back to it."
"I didn't come here to die."
"Are you kidding me right now?!"
"I've tried explosions, not a fan."
"Spike's dead, you're welcome."
"You made me care. Big mistake."
"All done, please don't hug me."
"And don't come back!"
"I've faced worse."
"Try that again, I dare you!"
"Almost got me! Ha, not."
"We did that. Lola, I know you'd be proud."
"That was clean, keep it up."
"We crushed it! Should we... celebrate or something?"
"Ow."
"Well, that was embarrassing."
"What did I say? Don't mess with me."
"Ayos! That's how we do it!"
"For their sake, I'm glad it's over."
"Next time, they're dead."
"I'll let them win."
"Not the worst."
"Oy Astra. How would I, hypothetically, go to other worlds, or whatever?"
*chuckles* "That's my thing. That's my secret!"
"Astra, your aim was on point! Husay!"
"Let's go, Brim. Ex-Kingdom represent!"
"Chamber, I'm here to fight. Whatever you're scheming, leave me out of it."
"Don't listen to that Chamber. What he wants is not what he says."
"Chamber's going down!"
"Bye, monsieur!"
"No more deals, Chamber!"
"Cypher, I am not kidding. If you take my picture I will fry that thing. Just try me."
"Cypher, get their good side. We don't want to be rude."
"Hanep, Cypher! Hope you caught all that on camera."
"Enough cameras. Their Cypher's gotta go."
"Found the spy."
"Nosy weirdo!"
"Save it Jett, I'm not racing you. You'd only embarrass yourself."
"Fair winds, tight corners. Time to show off, Jett."
"Jett wins again, I'm shocked."
"Do your thing, Jett!"
"That Jett is all speed, no skill. She's mine!"
"I'm gonna fry that bot!"
 "Neon, how much power do you generate, exactly? If I could just attach this meter-"
"Killjoy my suit's got, like, a billion volts. Don't touch it."
"That's my double, yeah? I got her."
"My double thinks she can take me? Bad call."
"Just my double. No problem."
"So Raze, you got a plan? Or are you gonna... y'know... do what you always do?"
"Oy, Raze? Raze! Ugh, 'di bale na."
"Wait, what? I'm listening to music, let me just- you say something? What did she say?"
"Raze, the plan is-... never mind, just keep blowing them up."
"Nice Raze, subtle!"
"Reyna, remind me to never piss you off."
"You and me, Reyna. No limits."
"That Reyna won't hold back. I won't either."
"I know Sage, don't hurt myself, but it's a gunfight so no promises."
"Galing mo, Sage! I gotta take notes!"
"I'm ready, Sage! We got this."
"Skye, I like morning runs, but morning implies sunlight. No more 4 AM wake ups, you maniac."
"Skye if your pets find them, tell me. I don't speak Wolf or Tiger, whatever."
"Bury their Skye!"
"Skye's fallen!"
 "Neon? What was that meal you made earlier, it was... good."
"Oh, my nanay's adobo? You're, uh, welcome."
