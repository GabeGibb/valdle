"Everyone is afraid of something."
"Bring them down!"
"Bring them down!"
"We found one."
"We found one."
"They're blind with fear."
"They're blind with fear."
"Close your eyes!"
"Take hold."
"Take hold."
"We'll catch them!"
"We'll catch them!"
"No escape."
"It was fate."
"Where are you?"
"Where are you?"
"I'll find you!"
"I'll find you!"
"Marked one!"
"Marked one!"
"Marked two!"
"Marked two!"
"Marked three!"
"Marked three!"
"Marked four!"
"Marked four!"
"Marked five!"
"Marked five!"
"Trying to hide?"
"Gotcha!"
"Right where I thought!"
"Nightmare, take them!"
"Face your fear!"
"I'm done with you"
"Inevitable."
"Contract complete."
"Dream no more."
"Like a fly in a web."
"Who are you? What do you want?"
"I'm in your head."
"The nightmare has you."
"Give him back to me."
"Look into the dark."
"I'm up, I'm up! Shit!"
"I paid a heavy price to commune with Nightmare. Don't waste it."
"It doesn't matter where they hide, I'll find them. I always find them."
"Hop! Eyes open, we have a job to do."
"Another mission? Good. Anything to keep me awake."
"There's truth in every dream, if you dig deep enough. Let's find out what they buried."
"Don't worry everyone, I won't tell them what scares you. Promise."
"Let's cut them down then plant the spike and sweep the stragglers into the trash!"
"We find what's hidden, we take it, then we leave."
"They think they can steal from us? Hadi lan, this is funny."
"How many times must we turn them away?! I'm getting aggravated."
"Many people died here. Their fear still lingers."
"One dream ends, another begins."
"Hesitation is for amateurs, let's go!"
"Pry open their mind, find the weakness."
"Their teeth will chatter in the cold and dark."
"Make their fear your weapon. Or use a gun, whichever."
"Boş yapmayın, keep fighting. Rest is overrated."
"They have courage, but no one is immune to fear."
"Dreams are a funny thing. One little twist, and it all turns dark."
"Whatever happens, sakin, don't panic. Trembling is bad for your aim."
"Hadi, again. Their fear is a track, and the track is fresh."
"Nice work lan. All of you."
"Keep hitting them like that and this job is done."
"Their heart rate just went up."
"Savor the good dreams while you can."
"We could finish this with our eyes closed! But I wouldn't recommend it."
"Güzel, we are doing very well."
"You don't need nightmare powers to see them shaking."
"Look at them, pale and sweating. All good signs."
"You see? There's still plenty of fun to be had."
"The nightmare turns in our favor."
"This fight isn't over until we are dead!"
"Buy what you need, otherwise we're going to look very stupid."
"Spend everything. Hoarding money is useless now."
"This is it! Their courage falters!"
"Their spirit is cracking! Now shatter it!"
"Yok ebesinin nikahı, we forgot the spike."
"Hey, isn't the spike important?"
"I will buy."
"I will buy."
"I will save."
"I will save."
"Who needs a weapon?"
"Who needs a weapon?"
"Anyone feeling generous?"
"Anyone feeling generous?"
"Push them back!"
"They are terrified."
"Shit, they're good."
"Fight harder!"
"Do not relent!"
"Keep them on the run."
"Never give in."
"Their line can't hold forever."
"Give me a challenge, ya?"
"Stay awake! They strike again."
"Make them fight for it."
"They will break against me."
"Stay focused."
"They are mine."
"Time to work."
"Where are they?"
"Their fears betray them."
"Sleep!"
"Ah be abi."
"Enemy down."
"Goodbye."
"Typical."
"Geber."
"Hush."
"İyi geceler."
"Night-night."
"Bam!"
"No more dreams."
"Yat aşağı."
"Rezalet!"
"Removed."
"Try again."
"Satisfying."
"Quietly now."
"Yikes."
"That makes three."
"That makes three."
"Four down!"
"Four down!"
"Did I get inside your head?"
"You should have run."
"I knew your every move."
"You were so close."
"Sweet dreams, asshole!"
"And I didn't even need a gun."
"So much for their elite agent!"
"Alright, one more."
"Alright, one more."
"No more distractions."
"Okay, where was I?"
"You have got to be kidding me!"
"Come on, come on! Please."
"Push a button, save the day, easy."
"Don't worry, I did all the work!"
"Your dreams are dust!"
"Did they really think they could scare me?"
"Not even sweating."
"You can't kill a nightmare!"
"Now this pleases me."
"Nothing's perfect, but, that was perfection."
"That's going to leave a scar."
"Next time we'll use wooden sticks! Make it fair."
"The nightmare is over, for them at least."
"Okay, time for coffee. My treat."
"We won, they lost. This is the way of things."
"Better than being at the bottom."
"If they see me again, I'll bury them all."
"When in doubt, let the astral guardian do the job."
"Breach! Clear a path."
"I choose to trust you, Brimstone. Show me I made the right choice."
"Chamber, I mark them, you shoot them. It's a good arrangement."
"So Chamber's more than just a nice suit, well done."
"Their Chamber is dangerous from afar. But up close, he bleeds like the rest of us."
"I'm gunning for Chamber."
"Missed me.""Fade, of all people, you've never asked to see my face."
"There are more valuable secrets than the look of someone. Will you share those?"
"There are more valuable secrets than the look of someone. Will you share those?"
"You have such a way with information, Cypher. After this, let's trade notes."
"Helal, Cypher. There is no hiding from you, is there?"
"Their Cypher has a fear filled with regret. Voices calling for help, and he cannot answer."
"Leave the dream seer to me."
"Silence, dream seer!"
"Sleep, my sister. You've seen too much."
"KAY/O, a radiant's nightmare. So glad we are very good friends."
"I admit, fighting beside a killer robot is a plus."
"Their KAY/O is tough. A bullet is tougher."
"Neon, nice work."
"Neon stopped."
"Omen, I wonder, how quickly can we unravel their will to fight?"
"With you and I in concert, immediately."
"Omen, with me. Nightmare thrives in the dark."
"Omen, that gave me the chills, abi. The good kind."
"Give them darkness, Omen."
"They brought along Omen. His fear is a sorrowful kind. Like a broken doll lost in the attic."
"Omen killed."
"Now your nightmare is over."
"Their Phoenix shines on the outside, but within I feel his doubt."
"Talking a big game doesn't mean much if you lose."
"Raze, you do not fear the chaos you inflict. I'm impressed."
"Reyna, after you take from the fallen, what remains? It makes me wonder."
"Hmph, that Reyna is not as fearless as she appears."
"I'll hunt down Skye."
"Sova, today, we hunt."
"Let's run them down, Sova."
"So much for recon."
"Together, Viper. Fear and toxin is an effective combination."
"We must make the enemy afraid. Look at Viper, yani. Scary mask, scary voice. She understands."
"Viper, oy! Holy shit!"
"Viper, fight with me."
"That Viper believes she is in control. She is not."
"Viper down."
"Goodbye Viper, well fought."
"Yoru can't hide from me."
