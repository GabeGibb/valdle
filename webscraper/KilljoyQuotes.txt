"Hah, turret killed them."
"Hah, turret killed them."
"Wait, really?!"
"Wait, really?!"
"Bot coming back."
"Bot coming back."
"Recalling my bot."
"Recalling my bot."
"Thanks bot!"
"Alley-oop!"
"Love my bots!"
"Bot assist."
"Tag teamed."
"Thanks botty!"
*laughs* "Initiated!"
"You should run."
"Lockdown destroyed!"
"Lockdown destroyed!"
"Area's clear!"
"Area's clear!"

"Fish in a barrel."
"Fish in a barrel."
"Trapped and zapped!"
"Trapped and zapped!"
"Had some trouble?"
"Had some trouble?"
"Fwoof! Heiliger strohsack, this is crazy!"
"I built literally everything on this battlefield. Ja, even the things that might kill us. What? You want me to say sorry?"
"Okay, I put together some data on our last six combat missions. Did you read it? Did anyone read it? Oh God, can anyone here read?"
"Don't worry team. If you die, I have your memories backed up at base! Heh, just kidding, just kidding. Or am I?"
"Swarm grenades? Check. Killer robots? Check- oh, hah, don't worry, they're only killer when I say so."
"If I'm not stressed, then you should not be stressed. I mean, look at me. Cool as a cucumber. *laughs* Ja, that's a thing Americans say, right?"
"These imposters actually think they can beat my tech? Ah, let's test that theory."
"Why is no one wearing the pulse monitors I gave you? Honestly, I ask for a few readouts and you think I'm Doctor Frankenstein!"
"Let's make this extraction quick. After this I'm going clubbing five timezones away, and a girl needs a moment to change."
"Oh! Oh! What if I sabotaged their defuser to speed up the timer instead! Oh man, how funny would that be!"
"Stealing our radianite is one thing, but I swear if they touch my coffee mug collection, I will erase them from existence."
"Meine güte! How many spikes do they have anyway? That tech's not cheap."
"If this town had let me install my defense matrix, we wouldn't have to be here! Ugh, oh well, I'll clean this up myself."
"Alpha this, Omega that, scheiße, who named these universes?! A und B would work perfectly well. We would be A, of course."
"Don't die. If you need help figuring out how, just ask!"
"Where are we going this time? Remember what worked in the past."
"Their tech is only as good as their skill, and there, we have them beat!"
"Everyone makes fun of German efficiency, haha. Just keep laughing as you use all my gear."
"You can trust my bots. They only malfunctioned that one time and, honestly, she won't miss that finger."
"Don't stress if I die. It was great knowing you all. Also, delete my hard drive."
"I can hold an area pretty well myself. Make sure to cover the angles I can't."
"Remember, your weapon is only a tool. You can't just shoot, you have to think!"
"They look like us, but are they us? I have so many questions."
"Everyone note down your observations, then let's run it again."
"Is everyone's tech still working? Double check it please."
*laughs* "They're thinking so hard, I can smell their circuits frying"
"Good! One step closer to being back in pajamas."
"Good. Analyze, then improve."
"They should probably reevaluate their approach."
"Let's see. Battles are won by geniuses. And I am a genius. So..."
*laughs* "I knew this would be easy but, meine güte!"
"I evaluated their strategy. It's a joke!"
"There we go. Finally, cracking their code."
"Their stale tactics would only work for so long."
"Oh, this is a much better trajectory!"
"Last round to use our creds and abilities. Don't waste your firepower!"
"Last round to use our creds and abilities. Don't waste your firepower!"
"Oh, we're almost done? Cool, hehe, cool cool cool."
"Once we win, just dump all your tech in my lab. I'll fix it up."
"Ugh, do I have to attach legs to the spike now?"
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm saving."
"I'm saving."
"I've got money, need something?"
"I've got money, need something?"
"Can I get this?"
"Can I get this?"
"Just cool down, we're good enough to win!"
"We're not their equal."
"Their defense? Uh, could be better."
"Find the leverage, and wedge it open."
"Nice and easy."
"Reevaluate tactics."
"Keep you heads on."
"Keep doing what you do best!"
"We can't keep doing the same things."
"Tactics beat firepower. Use that."
"We can keep them out."
"I anticipated us winning."
"Keep it cool. That's how you survive."
"Quick peeks now."
"Time for a field test."
"Don't overthink it, that's my job."
"Good."
"Auf Wiedersehen!"
"Goodbye!"
"Enemy down."
"One down!"
"Variable removed."
"Terminated."
"That's done."
"Finished."
"Got one!"
"Impeccable kill."
"Precise."
"Headshot."
"Perfect accuracy."
"Deleted."
"Power's out."
*laughs* "Oh, okay."
"Be smarter."
"Got three!"
"Got three!"
"Now four!"
"Now four!"
"Let me just swipe those biometrics."
*tuts* "You tried."
"Anticipated."
"Who could've predicted this? Alright, I did."
"They're all dead? I have more tests to run!"
"Have to keep it fun, you know?"
*laughs* "Is this their best?!"
"Final test!"
"Final test!"
"Don't interrupt my work."
"Imagine if I died, right now. So funny..."
"Oh, no no, you don't deserve my inventions."
"Go ahead! Call me tech support again!"
"I had to focus for a second."
"Calculated."
*laughs* "Ah, my genius doesn't stop in the lab."
"Flawless, what did they expect?"
*laughs* "Aww, they should stop playing checkers."
"Like clockwork."
"Ugh, okay, uh, where's Sage? This scheiße hurts."
"How about I only bring a ruler next time"
*laughs* "Who's up, for a debrief!? Anyone? No one?"
"Okay everyone, take a test tube. Thank you. Let's collect samples and get out of here."
"I knew it would all work out. It always does."
"Okay, that's done, time to lower this place."
*laughs* "Ah, my genius doesn't stop in the lab"
"Nearly perfect."
"Strong results. Let's run it again."
"I'm proud of that."
"Astra, after this let's grab coffee and talk theoretical physics. Just us girls, ja?"
"Breach, I wish you'd take my extra reactor coolant. Ugh, if your arms overheat out there, don't blame me!"
"I'll stop that Breach."
"Brimstone, remember your screen isn't frozen, it's just locked. And no, the internet isn't down. *sigh* It's never down."
"Brim, have you considered embedding your bracer in your limb? I can do that you know.""Killjoy, I say this with love, but stay the hell away from my arm!"
 "Killjoy, I say this with love, but stay the hell away from my arm!"
"Brimstone, that was wonderful!"
"Watch over us, Brimstone."
"It feels bad to kill that Brimstone. I mean I will. Just feels bad."
"Chamber, about that nanotech for your guns. Do you like, have any extra, or...?"
"They brought along Chamber?! I've seen his type before, overdresses, underdelivers!"
"Cypher, my condenser cables are missing from the lab again. Put them back please, thank you."
"Cypher, can you show me round the dark web one of these days?"
 "Oh, oh dear no sweetheart! We must protect you."
"Cypher, your homemade gadgets are so cute! Reminds me of some of my work in kindergarten."
"Cypher, let's keep sharing information. Every data point helps."
"I didn't realize we had two geniuses on the team!"
"Their eyes are down."
"Let's go, buckethead!"
"KAY/O, you are the best! Now imagine if you let me install those ordnance mods, huh? Huh?! Come on!"
"Okay, he's off. Now, where is the factory reset?"
"I know that Killjoy's tricks. Wait, she knows mine! Hah, finally, a challenge!"
"I'll show her who the real genius is."
"My double's dead."
"Huh, looks like I was the smarter one."
"Neon, how much power do you generate, exactly? If I could just attach this meter-"
 "Killjoy my suit's got, like, a billion volts. Don't touch it."
"I'll get that spooky ghost boy!"
 "Hey KJ, you good on the tech stuff? Need anything, you know, superheated?"
"Okay, that literally happened one time, Phoenix, stop asking."
"Raze, I found a new album you just have to hear! Maybe you could... come over after the mission? But, only if we survive!"
 "Killjoy, after this you wanna do some tinkering?"
"Sure, but if anything explodes again, you are telling Brim."
"Drive them crazy, Raze! You're good at that."
"Okay Raze, fine, your tinkering may... have made my tech better. Nice work."
"Be safe, Raze."
"The enemy Raze's tech is just spare parts and duct tape. It's a wonder she hasn't blown herself up."
"Sorry little mouse."
"Reyna, I can see why you don't want any of my tech. You're scary enough without it."
"Get them, Reyna!"
"It always feels like Reyna is after me personally. Does anyone else feel that way? Er, no? Just me?"
"Reyna killed."
"Sage killed."
"Skye, with a few genetic modifications, your animal flora could be even stronger. W-wait, was that offensive? Sorry."
"Okay, Skye. Get us to a good position, then I'll lock it down."
"Skye, you are so cool and collected, I'm almost jealous!"
"Show us the way, Skye."
"The enemy Skye is here, but don't worry! My robotics will beat her organics every time!"
"Nature girl down."
"Your creations were too primitive."
"They have Sova over there too? Can someone um, steal his eye? What? I wanna see what it's recorded."
"No more Sova."
"Viper, do you mind if I run today's tests. You're a little too biased, no offense."
"Viper, I'm speechless, and I always have something to say."
"There's a Viper over there. What a shame to rid the world of that mind. But I think she needs to rest."
"That Viper is so hateful, how could she even think straight?"
"You stopped thinking clearly. This is for the best."
"Aha, the cool kid in class has some brains too! Impressive!"
"That rift boy is going to teleport himself right into one of my traps."
"Look out for their rift walker."
