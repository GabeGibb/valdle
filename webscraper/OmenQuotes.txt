"If I must live in this nightmare, my enemies might as well join me."
"They fear death, they should fear so much more than that."
"Make the right choice, even if it calls for sacrifice."
"Who will they cry for, once they know they're going to die?"
"Do they know what it means to be...truly...afraid? I'll show them."
"Ugh, how many must I kill before I am restored. More, always more!"
"I already feel their hope dying and we haven't even begun. This will not take long."
"Wherever I go, obliteration follows. It is my legacy."
"You've brought your monster from monstrous work. Fitting."
"The enemy brought a spike. Kill them."
"Do not let them plant that spike. Radianite explosions are... complicated."
"Is that a statue of me? This is unexpected."
"Split. Ah, they don't know the meaning of the word."
"I'll make them remember... they're only human."
"My burden never ends."
"I feel the strain. Block it out, Omen."
"Their backs will be towards at least one of us."
"Look for my shadows, they will hide you."
"Wait until I blind them to strike."
"I will take back what is mine."
"They think they know pain? They can't begin to comprehend it."
"Strike at their weak points. If one link breaks the rest will follow."
"I survived obliteration. I will survive them."
"That was terrifying."
"Good. Keep your focus."
"Again. Hurt them again."
"Kick them when they're down."
"I can feel their panic rising. Drive it into them."
"Their fear blinds them."
"Sad fools standing in our way."
"Their nightmare is becoming real."
"Keep yourself together. You can't fall apart now."
"I feel like myself. Catch them. Again."
"We are not done."
"Spend everything. We keep nothing."
"Spend everything. We keep nothing."
"I know how this will end."
"Put them to sleep."
"Can't even remember the spike."
"We don't have the spike!"
"I'm buying."

"I'm saving."
"I can buy."

"I need this."
"I need this."
"I must hold together."
"Hold our ground."
"Watch them falter."
"Give them no ground."
"Cut their walls down."
"Do you smell their panic?"
"We can't stumble now."
"I will break the balance."
"I must endure."
"They're weak. Good."
"Keep it together."
"I am not just a shadow."
"I will be their nightmare."
"I am everywhere."
"Claw through them."
"It begins."
"I will rip the light from them."
"Cower, run."
"Snuff them out."
"Die."
"Begone."

"Five dead."
"It is finished."
"Petty things."
"Rest. It is done."
"You didn't see that coming."
"Still just human."
"You thought you could escape my nightmare?!"
"One more."
"One more."
"Shameful performance."
"Shameful performance."
"Oh, what's another death?"
"What's another death?"
"Their spike is defused."
"Worthless dead fools."
"You forget your place."
"That was fun."
"They died underneath our boots."
"Pity the man who dies meaningless."
"History has already forgotten you."
"You think you can kill me?"
"I need nothing to win."
"Rest now. I will keep watch."
"Out of my way."
"Hold on to this moment. We can't stop here."
"You thought you could escape my nightmare?!"
"This is only the start."
"Close, I am so close!"
"I can be even more."
"Astra, your power sends shimmers through your veils, it is mesmerizing. Can no one else see them? Pity."
"Shine for us, Astra."
"The Astra is gone, and her mysteries with her."
"I'll silence their Breach."
"Kill their leader and the rest will flee like rats."
"Expertly done, Chamber."
"Do you see under my hood, Cypher? Does it scare you?"
"No more meddling."
"Omen, I wonder, how quickly can we unravel their will to fight?"
"With you and I in concert, immediately."
"Together, Fade. We will show them the true meaning of fear."
"Fade, we endure."
"Fade, that was a work of art."
"They have brought Fade, a consciousness as strained as my own. This will be interesting."
"That Fade spreads terror well. Let me give her a dose of her own medicine."
"Let go."
"Be at peace."
"That relic won't work for just anyone, Harbor. Why you? Curious."
"Your combat precision, Harbor, I swear I've seen it before. A past life maybe."
"Jett, you were a storm. Well done."
"I will get inside their inventor's head. Even brilliant minds will break to madness."
"There is another of me? How many times did I get ripped apart? How many times did I die?"
"I'll kill that Omen. I'll take his memories. I will remember."
"I will kill you, Omen."
"I will find you, Omen."
"Now rest."
"Let go."
"You can finally let go."
 "Hey Omen, I respect a guy who knits. That's pretty cute."
"It helps me focus! Oh, what do you care?"
"I will snuff out Phoenix's fire."
"Raze, sow your chaos."
"There is a Raze. I sense her laughter. Hmm, to laugh again."
"Reyna, the souls you consume. Do you hear their voices as I do?"
"The enemy fears you, Reyna. You can use that."
"That was incredible, Reyna. And they call me the monster."
"Reyna, unleash your power."
"Sage, the life you give, do you ever wonder where it's taken from?"
"Sage, you are truly limitless."
"A Radiant healer is with them. I can feel her pull against the natural balance."
"Keep hunting them down! Their Sage cannot protect them all."
"Sage killed."
"I've reset the balance."
"Skye the life weaver. The power to create, to destroy. Which path will you embrace, I wonder?"
"Oh, there is a terrible beast inside you, Skye. Unleash it."
"Well done, Skye! Nature's wrath indeed."
"Erase their Skye."
"Killed their Skye."
"What would you have become, Skye? Ugh, it doesn't matter now."
"There is a fury in you, Sova. It is terrible. Beautiful."
"Their Sova thinks himself a hunter. What will he do when he feels me closing in?"
"Don't die here, Sabine. I need your secrets."
"Sabine, look at the monsters we've become. At least you have flesh to hide your horror."
 "Joh- I mean, Omen. Keep yourself together, you're still needed."
"Wait, what did you say? I'm hearing so many things."This line has a  that has been intentionally replaced. 
"Just think, Sabine. You used to heal with your skill. Funny."
"Stay alive, Sabine."
"Experiment complete."
"Goodbye, Sabine."
"I'm curious, rift walker. When you travel, can you feel the pieces you leave behind?"
"Where should we go, rift walker? They cannot watch everywhere at once."
"They are no match for you, rift walker. Not even close."
"Tear them apart, rift walker."
