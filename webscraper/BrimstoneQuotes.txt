"Smokes down."
"Smokes down."
"Launching smoke."
"Launching smoke."
"Fully smoked."
"Fully smoked."
"Open up the sky!"
"Prepare for hellfire!"
"Deep fried!"
"Ain't my time!"
"No one die on me! We're all going home."
"They can throw the whole playbook at us. I've seen it all before."
"I can't close the settings menu on my bracer. How do I- oh, got it."
"Different battlefield, same crap."
"They've got one ugly lookin' crew. No offense to any of us."
"Failure is the great teacher. So let's teach 'em somethin'!"
"Okay kids, we've got company. Pretend you all get along."
"Alright team, let's go write this war story shall we?"
"Let's ready up! We're here for radianite, and we're not leaving 'til it's ours."
"They picked the wrong day to mess with our world."
"What did Kingdom get itself into this time?"
"I would hate working here. You couldn't pay me to sit at a desk."
"Pay attention. Might learn something."
"No more doubts. We're ready."
"Let's ruin their day."
"I'll teach 'em to respect their elders."
"Shoot the bad guys! How's that for a plan?"
"Stay in range of my stim beacon, and we'll mow them down."
"Ugh, who am I kiddin'. My knees are gonna kill after this."
"Remember to talk to each other out there. If we communicate, we win."
"Drink some water, reload your mags, and let's get back out there."
"My smokes can block the enemy's line of sight. Once they're blind, we move."
"Just like we practiced."
"That's the way."
"Good! Again."
"Damn right we crushed it! Ugh, even as I was saying it- when Jett says it- you know what, forget it."
"What do they think this is, a backyard scrimmage?"
"Keep taking this seriously, even if they aren't."
"What are they doing over there? When the play's not working, call an audible!"
"Now we're landing haymakers!"
"Punch us in the teeth, we spit back blood."
"Finally off the ropes."
"Never count out the underdog."
"If you saved, spend it."
"Half time! Don't save a thing."
"You've earned this win, let's make it official!"
"Finish 'em off!"
"The day is almost ours, take it!"
"I like the enthusiasm, but no one grabbed the spike!"
"Anyone wanna get the spike?!"
"Grabbing gear'."
"Grabbing gear'."
"I'm saving."
"I'm saving."
"I've got cash, anyone need something?"
"I've got cash, anyone need something?"
"Need equipment."
"Need equipment."
"They've got nerve!"
"Who do they think they are?"
"Cut 'em down to size!"
"This ain't what they signed up for."
"Don't get rusty."
"Rein 'em in!"
"Light 'em up!"
"Stay sharp."
"Have at 'em."
"Steady."
"It's our turn."
"Time to take this hill."
"Together!"
"Watch and learn."
"You know what to do."
"Safeties off."
"Taken down."
"Outta here."
"Goner."
"Down you go."
"Enemy down."
"Who trained you?"
"See ya!"
"Gotcha."
"Now we're cookin'."
"Down and out."
"Headshot!"
"Still got it!"
"On the money."
"Hotshot."
"Right between the eyes."
"Like butter, baby."
"Cut down."
"That'll work."
"That's three."
"That's three."
"And four."
"And four."
"That's the lot of 'em."
"Bagged and tagged."
"Not one left standing."
"Okay, time for a protein shake."
"We got five, that's bingo."
"Sometimes you gotta get your hands dirty."
"I don't need a gun."
"Not so tough after all."
"Finish it up."
"Finish it up."
"Nice try, kid."
"Nice try, kid."
"Hold on to your hats."
"Hold on to your hats."
"Not the boom you hoped for."
"Sorry to spoil the party."
"Get off my lawn!"
"I'm king of this hill!"
"This horse kicks!"
"Who's the old dog now?"
"That's why they put me in charge."
"There's some things you just can't teach."
"Fish in a barrel."
"Ain't much room for improvement!"
"They're out-thought, outfought!"
"It's just a scratch!"
*winces* "I'm too stubborn to die!"
"Any cheaper, and it'd be just me and a bottle of scotch."
"I'll never retire."
"Feelin' proud."
"Never had a doubt!"
"Good work! Now, let's evac this rock before it falls out of the sky!"
"Who's the old dog now?"
"I'll win the next one."
"I let them win."
"Hey, not half bad."
"Astra, help me manage the field? A bird's eye view is one thing, then there's whatever the hell you got."
"Don't let their Astra dictate our battle. Find the angle, take control.""Brimstone, the corporate sellout! Here to look out for Kingdom's special interests?"
"You don't know what you're talking about, Breach."
"You don't know what you're talking about, Breach."
"You did well, Breach. Don't expect a hug."
"An enemy Breach? Ugh, there goes my good day."
"Someone knock that Breach on his ass."
"That Breach is asking for it."
"Jackass."
"If any of you got a problem with me, take it out on my double."
"That Brimstone's a stubborn ass. Heh, reminds me of someone."
"One Brimstone is enough."
"Pour one out."
*sigh* "Haha, show-off!"
"For a straight shooter, that Chamber sure can talk in circles."
"Stay out of Chamber's sights."
"So they got a Cypher. He'll see what we want him to see."
"Jett, remember to stretch. I don't want you to sprain an ankle at 90 miles an hour."
"Sit still!"
"There's something about you, KAY/O. Don't know what it is yet, but I like it."
"Brimstone, game plan! Let's do what we did at the Battle of Hell's Bridge."
"KAY/O, I have no idea what you're talking about."
"Get a move on, agent."
"Sorry friend, just doing my job."
"Killjoy, do you control the admin account on my bracer? I... might need you to reset the password."
"Brim, have you considered embedding your bracer in your limb? I can do that you know."
"Killjoy, I say this with love, but stay the hell away from my arm!"
"Killjoy, control your bots! That turret keeps looking at me funny."
"Killjoy, I'm counting on that noggin'."
"Sorry kid."
"You left me no choice, kid."
"Let's roll, Neon. Show us what that K-SEC training did for ya."
"The enemy needs a good scare. Omen! You're up!"
"Omen! You are a force of nature!"
"Human or not, that Omen can be killed."
"I wanna see heroes, not heroics. Lookin' at you, Phoenix!"
"Phoenix, if you keep pulling stunts like that, you can brag as much as you like."
"We're fighting a Phoenix? Book your vacations now, this is gonna be exhausting."
"Ugh, shut that Phoenix up!"
"Fire's out."
"That's how the boss does it."
"Brimstone, chefinho! Thanks for the paint canisters, ha, best gift ever!"
"You bet, and don't use them all in one day."You bet, and don't use them all in one day."
"Raze, give 'em hell!"
"Oh, perfect, a hostile Raze. Kill her before she brings this whole place down on top of us."
"It's open season on the enemy Reyna. If you get a shot at that heart, take it."
"Let's kill that Reyna! Our team's got soul, I wanna keep it that way."
"Sage, if I die out there, you're in charge. Someone has to look after these knuckleheads."
"Sage, remember that you can't save everyone. We save who we can, that's enough."
"Sage, you're working miracles."
"Take us in, Skye! I want you on the front lines. Bring the whole damn zoo."
"Sova, you look after yourself. You already lost an eye for us. One's enough."
"Sova, we need eyes. Show us where they are."
"Sova, we need eyes on the enemy. Tell us where they are."
"I'm with you Sova."
"At ease, soldier."
"Viper, watch those toxins this time. Not breathing in that crap again."
"Brimstone, we really need to put an age floor on VALORANT. I can't take this... youth."
"They're the future Sabine! You know you care about them."
"You want revenge Viper? Now's your chance."
"Careful Viper, you'll scare the kids!"
"Steady Viper."
"That poor Viper, we didn't have to be your enemy."
"I hope you find peace."
