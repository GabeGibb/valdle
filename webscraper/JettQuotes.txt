"Give me those back."
*sighs* "Cool"
"Think you can keep up? Who am I kidding? You know you can't keep up."
"Huh! Who are you all? The cleanup crew?"
"I would make fun of their dumb faces, but they're us! Huh, we look stupid."
"Feels like just yesterday I was chopping 달래 at the store. Wonder if that place is still standing."
"Oh, I'm hungry. Anyone hungry? Lunch on Brimstone after this!"
"I know I dash around a lot, but I promise I'm looking out for y'all. Take them out while they're busy with me."
"Ayy, the gang's all here! This is great, they don't stand a chance!"
"Careful of the edges! Not sure if I could catch you in time if you fell off. I mean, I'd try of course."
"Woo! We got this."
"I got your backs. Just, y'know, from the front."
"Wind, show me where to go."
"We get a pick, we move in. Got it?"
"Let's get these idiots."
"I hate to say it but *sighs* probably best to play as a team. So, uh, what's the plan?"
"This place is nice, but not nice enough to die in. Let's win and get outta here."
"Just let them try to catch me."
"Woo, okay, we know the drill. Stick to your roles and we'll crush it."
"Race you to the spike sites!"
"I'm amped! Let's go! I got things to do."
"Keep it up. Screw up, and they're on us!"
"Let's blow them over."
"Sweet, that went well! Alright, same thing this time."
"Nice, killed it! And them. We definitely killed them."
"They're supposed to be fighting back, right?"
"Damn right we're crushing it!"
"This is fun. Who needs training dummies when you have real dummies!"
"Yeah! Let's bring it back."
"Finally. This is how I like to win."
"We're gonna win. No other option. Let's go."
"We lose everything after this. Spend it."
"Use everything you have, we lose it anyway."
"Oh look! They're desperate."
"Let's end this."
"Guys, come on. The spike!"
"And the spike's still in base."
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm gonna save."
"I'm gonna save."
"I have extra money if anyone needs."
"I have extra money if anyone needs."
"Need a drop."
"Need a drop."
"Keep it up!"
"Let's take at least one down with us!"
"Time to mix things up."
"Even fight? That's fun."
"They're not better than me."
"You can't catch us!"
"Do it again!"
"Good work! Don't screw it up."
"Let's take what they have."
"Hold those angles!"
"This is our home. Keep them out!"
"Are they asleep?"
"Let's crack them open."
"Keep up."
"Keep up."
"Let's go."
"Let's go!"
"Let's fly."
"Stay safe."
"This is gonna be fun!"
"Bye!"
"Stay down!"
"One down."
"See ya!"
"Yikes!"
Jett scoffs
"Oof!"
"Enemy killed."
"Night night!"
"Oops!"
"Be faster."
"Headshot."
"Your fault!"
"Duck!"
"Nailed them."
"Ha, gottem!"
"Oh no!"
"Embarrassing!"
"Three."
"Three."
"Four."
"Four."
"Last one down."
"There you are, you little shit."
"There you are."
"You? Outrun me?"
"Aww, thought you'd try harder!"
"Yikes, that sucks!"
"Don't stress. I'm super quiet."
"Looks like I was the stronger one."
"Okay, where's the straggler?"
"Okay, where's the straggler?"
"Aww, at least they tried."
"Aww, they tried."
*sighs* "This, is nothing"
"This, is nothing."
"Aww. Was that important?"
"Ha! You should've seen your faces!"
"Easy."
"Get out."
"Huh, oh wow. You guys suck."
"What would you all do without me?"
"Oh, my back hurts! Everyone's so heavy!"
"Wow, so embarrassing!"
"Ha! We crushed them!"
*laughs* "You're terrible!"
"Dying, would've sucked."
"I could not have made that easier!"
"Too easy."
"I'm bored. Let's go."
"Was that supposed to be a fight?"
"Woo, okay! Sauna time!"
"Oh, my back hurts! Everyone's so heavy!"
"What would you all do without me?"
"Alright, I'll take it, I'll take it."
"Could've been first if I tried."
"Whatever. Good for now."
"Breach, my man!"
"Knock 'em down, Breach."
"Watch out for Breach's impacts. It's hard to move after that."
"Yo, Brimstone! You know the drill. Just show me where to go."
"Hell yeah, Brimstone! The best defense, is a good offense."
"You better hide, old man!"
"You gotta retire sometime."
"Cypher, just tell me where they are. I'll do the rest."
"I'll find their Cypher."
"Eyes down."
"I know your tricks, wind girl. You're not faster than me!"
"Their Jett has nothin' on me. I got her."
"Clone killed."
"Grounded."
"No way, we're the same!"
"Yo, Killjoy? Think you could enhance my knives at some point? Maybe some lasers, homing tech. I-I'm just spitballing here."
"Alright, I take back what I said about those bots. They're pretty good. And, so are you."
"Maybe their Killjoy isn't as smart as ours. I don't wanna deal with her if she is."
"I'll show you scary, Omen."
"Hey Phoenix! If I die? Viking funeral, all the way."
"Hey Phoenix, if you die, I call dibs on your jacket.""Ah don't be like that, you know you'd also want my shoes."
 "Ah don't be like that, you know you'd also want my shoes."
"Don't mess up that pretty face, Phoenix."
"Where's that smile, Phoenix?"
"Phoenix, yo! That was insane!"
"Aww, sorry pretty boy!"
"There's my bombshell! Crushed it, girl."
"Party's over."
"Reyna, damn! Even I couldn't keep up!"
"Do what you gotta do, Reyna."
"Sage, you lock 'em down, and I'll take them out. Just like we practiced."
"Wow, Sage! When you turn it on, you turn it on! Great work!"
"Keep those heals comin'!"
"C'mon guys, take out their healer! It's super annoying to kill people twice."
"Her slow fields are so annoying!"
"Just gotta play around the slow fields, and we're fine."
"Healer down."
"Aww, can't res yourself?"
"Skye. Ever though thought about making other summons? Like, uh, lions. Or, ooh, dragons!"
 "Tried once. It was not pretty."
"Forge us a path, Skye. I'll be right behind ya."
"Owls, hawks. What the hell? The sky's crowded nowadays."
"I'm faster than Skye's wolves."
"I still can't get over that owl, Sova. It's too cute. Why is it so cute?"
"Let that Sova find me, whatever. It'll help him look death in face."
"You better run, Sova."
"Viper, be careful with that gas!"
