"Miss me?"
"I'm right here."
"Looking for me?"
"Who killed me? They're dead!"
"Should I shoot them in the face, or stab them in the back? I'll decide later."
"So much fuss over nothing. Someone get me a bat, I'll finish this."
"It's easiest if I sneak in and kill everyone. Don't make this complicated."
"You're all obsessed with teamwork, so I'll try it. But just this once."
"Five enemies. Five for me, none for anyone else."
"A bunch of ざこ want to fight us. They must really want to die."
"These guys caught me in a mood. Bad luck for them."
"Five defenders?! Double that, then we'll call it fair!"
"If they keep stealing our radianite, I'll have to take it personally."
"There are more answers here. I just have to find them."
"An underwater city. Great."
"This neighborhood used to be so much better without this Kingdom shit."
"Never show weakness. Ever."
"Pick something nice to kill them with. it's the least we can do."
"I don't care if there are five of them or fifty of them. Let's go!"
"The dimensional fabric here is thin. I'll tear through."
"ざこ better watch their backs."
"Don't stop fighting. You must keep going, even if you are the only one."
"I'll pick them apart. You clean up whatever's left."
"Move in after I strike. That's when they're weak."
"They forgot who they're dealing with."
"That wasn't terrible."
"Keep after them!"
"I like you guys a lot better when we don't lose."
"They must have a death wish or something."
"They should give up now, save us the effort."
"How did every piece of trash end up on the same team?"
"That's it. Keep going!"
"This isn't over!"
"Hm, their luck ran out."
"Spend your money now. There's no bank in hell."
"Spend your money now. There's no bank in hell."
"Let's end this."
"Let's clean up. We're done here."
"Anyone gonna get the spike?"
"Hey! You forgot the spike!"
"I'm buying."
"I'm buying."
"I'm saving."
"I'm saving."
"I can buy for you. What do you want?"
"I can buy for you. What do you want?"
"I need a drop."
"I need a drop."
"They want more of me? Fine."
"I'll turn this around."
"You all have guns. Now use them!"
"Get them out of here."
"I'm afraid this might get rough."
"Don't let them get up."
"They're tough. おもしれぇ."
"No more games."
"Keep hitting them."
"Give them nothing!"
"Just try and get past me."
"Now they've pissed me off!"
"Jump 'em!"
"I'll cut through."
"Try not to die."
"Hit them when they're not looking."
"Anyone else?"
"Die."
"Don't get up."
"Dead!"
"Idiot!"
"Bad luck."
"Killed them."
"Lights out."
"Back off."
"You're done."

"ざこが."
"Pathetic."
"Get out of my way!"
"Three."
"Three."
"Four."
"Four."
"Your biggest mistake was that you pissed me off."
"It's my Earth. Now get out!"
"Dead is a good look for you."
"You died last. Good job."
"Sorry. This world's taken."
"Wow. You really suck."
"You tried to be a hero. Great job."
"One left."
"One left."
"Stop trying."
"Stop trying."
"くそ!"
"くそ!"
"Good try, idiots."
"Send five more, we can do this again!"
"Anyone else think they can kill a god?"
"So I saved the day. Don't make a big deal about it."
"Well they sucked."
"Thanks for helping me take out the trash."
"Dying, is for other people."
"If you're gonna buy a gun, then shoot me."
"Call me when the world ends again. I'd hate to miss it."
"I'm leaving now. See you at the next apocalypse."
"I'm done here."
"Who were you, ancestor? Where the hell did you go?!"
"I was the best? I'm shocked."
"Fine for now."
"Huh, not bad."
"I'll show off next time."
"Astra, send the enemies towards me. I'm ready!"
"It's impressive what Breach can do when he shuts up for a second."
"I already hear that Breach running his mouth. Don't tell me you'll punch me, just punch me!"
"Shut up!"
"Have fun in hell!"
"Who let that old man out of the nursing home?"
"Help that old man find his grave."
"Brimstone's dead."
"Chamber, back me up."
"Huh, they dragged Chamber out of his corner office. I can smell his cologne from here."
"That Cypher thinks he sees everything. I go invisible, idiot! Come get me!"
"That Cypher is a dead man."
"Killed their Cypher."
"What brand are your knives, Jett? They're not 'Mammoth'. 'Segreto', maybe? I need one for my collection."
"You made them look like idiots, Jett. You should do that again."
"KAY/O, I'm impressed!"
"Their KAY/O kills radiants, huh? We'll see."
"It seems your science shit has some use after all, Killjoy."
"There's a Killjoy and her bots. So annoying."
"That Killjoy's tech is everywhere! We're not at a science fair, get rid of that shit!"
"Class dismissed."
"Stick with me Neon, we'll run circles around them."
"Don't let their Neon get around you."
"Rest well, Neon. See you in another life."
"Omen, let's teleport and spook those guys."
"That was good, Omen. Smile."
"Omen, let's flank them."
"The enemy Omen's like me. He'll try to get behind us. Watch your backs."
"Okay Yoru, right here, right now. We'll see who's the better shot."
"Fine, but I'll keep score."
"Phoenix, for once in your life, try waiting for the team. I know you can do it."
"Phoenix! Don't get blood on that jacket."
"Don't look so smug, Phoenix!"
"That Phoenix won't be smiling when I'm done with him."
"Embarrassing."
"Show's over."
"Raze, remember this is a covert mission. At least try not to give us away."
"You're here to take my kills, Reyna? Let's make it a competition."
"Reyna, I'll take one side if you take the other. They'll be dead in five seconds."
"Nice, Reyna. I don't know why the rest of us are even here."
"Reyna, with me."
"Why did they bring Sage? Now they have to die twice. Idiots."
"Hey, flower girl. I found some leaves. Do you want them?"
 "I've got enough, thanks. But call me flower girl again, I'll break your nose."
"Skye, you've been holding back."
"Skye that was-" *clears throat* "that was pretty good."
"Good luck, Skye."
"The enemy Skye is here. I never liked the zoo."
"Skye killed."
"Find them, Sova. I'll do the rest."
"Let's see what you've got, Sova."
"That Viper really needs to die."
"I'll take down their Viper."
"That's me over there! Great, now I can kick my own ass."
