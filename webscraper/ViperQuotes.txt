"Poison orb emitting."
"Poison's off."
"Poison's off."
"Toxins going up."
"Toxin screen down."
"Don't get in my way!"
"Welcome to my world!"
"Fascinating, I must record this feeling."
"Only five of them? Pity I brought enough poison for fifty. You can't say I'm not prepared."
"Use my poison to your advantage, I don't deploy it for kicks."
"I wonder if these ones will beg. They all do after a while."
"They call me a monster. Shall I prove them right?"
"Bodies decompose after twelve hours in acid. There's no reason I know that."
"Let's take from them what they took from me - everything!"
"They are not important. Let's move through them, like smoke through lungs."
"I was saving my best poison for a special occasion but our guests came all this way. It's the least I can do."
"The lies we've told this city. Just to pry it open and suck it dry."
"I knew some of them, the people here. Good scientists."
"This dome won't protect the city forever. They wanna survive? Stop hiding!"
"My priority is their suffering."
"I'll choke their sight."
"Make them beg."
"I hear them scream."
"Who to smother first?"
"Look them in the eyes when you kill them."
"They will die. Hopeless and afraid."
"Remember, nobody's a hero when they're crying for air."
"If any of you die I lose a bet with Brimstone, so don't embarrass me like that, please."
"They're nothing but flies."
"No one will remember them."
"If you lose focus, you die. Breathe when it's over."
"Good work, keep going."
"Ah, this is what I live for."
"Keep kicking them down."
"Some vermin are born to die, like rats in a lab."
"It's hard not to play with my food."
*laughs* "Oh, if only I could always feel like this."
"Again. Don't stop! I want them in pieces!"
"Oh it's personal now."
"They had their fun. Now it's my turn."
"Time to kneel."
"Can't take anything with us after this. Go for broke."
"We can't take anything with us after this."
"They're in the coffin. Time to bury them."
"One last push. Let's make them hurt."
"We end them here, we end them forever."
"Idiots, the spike! Now!"
"Someone get the spike!"
"Buying."
"Buying."
"Saving."
"I'm saving."
"Funds to spare."
"Need a loan?"
"Anyone have funds to spare?"
"Anyone have funds to spare?"
"We will hurt them."
"Hurt those who hurt us."
"Enough playing with our food."
"Keep them back."
"They keep clawing at our wall. Pathetic."
"Bury them."
"Leave no trace of them."
"Stop their advance."
"Their hope is their poison."
"Hopeless mice."
"Hold them under."
"I will not lose my home again!"
"Let's go."
"I want to see you crawl."
"Breathe deep."
"Isolate them, and kill them."
"Isolate and exterminate."
"Kill them."
"Let's choke them."
"I'll take everything from them."
"Breathe deep."
"Ended."

"What a way to die."
"Dead fool."
"Ouch."

"Squashed."

"Erased."
"Not worth the bullets."
"Shh..."
"Three down."
"Three down."
"Four down."
"Four down."
"What a way to die."
"What a way to die."
"We're done here."
"You wanted to be a hero, didn't you?"
"You wanted to be a hero, didn't you?"
"Well, you tried."
"Back where you belong - in the dirt."
"This is everything I wanted, wasn't it?"
"Didn't need a gun for that one."
"Shh..."
"That was their best? Pathetic."
"One left."
"One left."
"Annoying fly."
"Annoying fly."
"Now, where was I?"
"I can't die here."
"Oh shit, shit, come on."
"Dying here would be unfortunate."
"Spike defused."
"No need for this."
"You wanted a villain? I gave you a villain!"
"If you want something done right, do it yourself."
"You only thought that was close."
"I almost broke a sweat."
"It's sad really."
"Poor things."
"How demoralizing."
*winces* "They think they can kill me?"
"I won't be stopped."
"I can't make this easier for them."
"Should I use a stick next time?"
"Hide the bodies, we weren't here."
"I am your monster. You made me this way! Never forget that."
"You should've begged sooner."
"You were only in my way."
"Anticipated."
"Well the town is gone, but our world stays afloat. I'll take that trade."
"I am your monster. You made me this way! Never forget that."
"You should've begged sooner."
"Next time I'll take their heads- I mean, first place."
"This'll do, for now."
"I guess this is fine."
"Do me a favor Breach and, uh, open them up. Toxin works best when directly injected."
"Well done, Breach! I knew hiring you was a good idea."
"Breach killed."
"Don't tell me what to do, old man. Someone will die, no matter how fancy our strategy."
"Brimstone, we really need to put an age floor on VALORANT. I can't take this youth.""They're the future, Sabine! You know you care about them."
 "They're the future, Sabine! You know you care about them."
"I'm impressed, Brimstone! Looks like the fire is still lit."
"Get some sleep, old man."
 "Viper, you must let me take you out some time. Dinner, dancing, I know the perfect place."
"Chamber, I would rather drink my own poison."
"Chamber, you've made promises we expect you to keep. Less flirting, more focus. Thank you."
"You want my approval, Chamber? Do that again."
"You were charming, but not as clever as you think."
"Cypher, you collect information. Tell me, what are their dreams? What do they fear?"
 "You know, Viper, the name Sabine really fits you."
"Never call me that again! If you do though it's Doctor Sabine, get it right."
"Tell me where they are, Cypher. I'll take care of the rest."
"Hunt them down, Cypher."
"Their Cypher might find us. Good. Bring them to me."
"I'll find their Cypher."
"Cypher killed."
"To be young and have reflexes again. Good work, Jett."
"What a shame to take Jett's young life. Truly, a pity."
"Something wrong, KAY/O? Death's on your conscience? We're not so different after all."
"You did well, little mouse. Keep it up."
"Their Killjoy is too smart for her own good. I'll reprimand her."
"Neon, you can practice restraint later. You're at war now. I need the storm."
"Neon? What was that meal you made earlier, it was... good."
 "Oh, my nanay's adobo? You're, uh, welcome."
"Neon? You know I'm supposed to be the scary one, right?"
"Neon, strike them down."
"Joh- I mean, Omen. Keep yourself together, you're still needed."
 "Wait, what did you say? I'm hearing so many things."
"One more time, Omen." *laughs* "How many times have you heard that now?"
"Keep being their nightmare, old friend."
"I wonder what's inside of their Omen. What truth is he keeping from ours?"
"Keep your fire going, Phoenix."
"Burn them, Phoenix!"
"Fire needs oxygen. Let me replace this Phoenix's air."
"Phoenix down."
"Raze, I will deny that I said this but your inventions are... valuable. Keep tinkering."
"I'll shut that Raze up."
"What's it like, Reyna, fighting to keep a loved one alive? No, please. Tell me."
"Fill your heart, Reyna. If you want results, I need those souls."
"Reyna, a woman after my own heart. You can't have it though."
"I respect the predation of their Reyna. It's almost inspiring."
"Eat your own heart out, Reyna."
"Reyna's gone."
"Sage, you're the only one who can keep us alive. Don't fail us now like you failed me then."
 "Viper, have you thought about my offer? You don't have to-"
"Never, ever assume you can help me. You can't help me, you can't help them!"
"Stand strong, Sage."
"That's payback, Sage!"
"Guide us, Skye. Find your strength along the way."
"Skye, you have no clue the forces you're playing with. Eh, don't worry, you'll be dead before you figure it out."
"Skye's dead."
"Well done, Sova. You truly are a hunter."
"I'll crush their Sova's spirit."
"Sabine, Sabine, what have you been working on over there? I'm curious, but you don't need to be alive for me to find out."
"Ugh, my air filters don't work on her poison. Why? I'll figure it out."
"I'm coming for you, Sabine!"
"Copy killed."
"Rest, you tired woman."
"You choked on your own poison! Tragic."
"You have the ability to rift-walk and you stay here? What a shame, there are so many better worlds out there."
"Stay quiet!"
