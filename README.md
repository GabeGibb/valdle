# Setup Guide
- Download python (ours is 3.10.6 but most recent versions should work)
- pip install the requirements.txt file
- Run the testing.py script

# Current Goals
- Try your very best to write general JS and CSS styles in order to avoid duplicate styling and repeated code
- Every page should be somewhat visually appealing but not perfect
- Getting things working > everything else
- Do not worry too much about mobile view at the moment, but plan designs to have things centered so it can easily be adapted to a mobile view
- User experience should be prioritized (EX: if users need to search something there should be a button to execute the search, users could also press enter, if its an autofill search clicking on a possible option should also
execute the search.
