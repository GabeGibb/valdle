# Updating game info

-   Run the downloadApi script (downloads agents / weapons / maps)
-   Update guessAgent.js manually (gender and year at the top)
-   Add the quote to the agent manually in the quotes_en.json file (IN CORRECT INDEX POSITION)
-   Map is done via downloading and checking. Uncomment js code in guessMap to debug. Add to html. Feed images to compress_image script and compress with tiny png.
